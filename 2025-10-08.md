## Journal
I setup "claudesidian" yesterday a setup from heyitsnoah, Noah Brier. I was stoked to find this as I had listened to him on a podcast `AI&I` and his seetup was incredible how he uses Obsidian, claudecode, a home server with tailscale, and terminus on his iphone to basically think out loud and get AI to process his thoughts, do research on the move, and to even code" I haven't got the server setup yet, but working on it. Really excited by this because I do a lot of walking/running and this is where a lot of my thinking happens and I struggle to write down these thoughts by the time I get back home. Also, I'm going to try to setup wispr.flow (he didn't mention that) but I think that will be the best way for me to talk to claudcode in terminus on my phone. We'll see. I'm excited. I've also been hearing about all of these ai devices, and granola.io etc. and I am curious about them but one thing at a time. I may end up moving this repo into my obsidian vault, not sure how to do that because if you know anything about obsidian it's a note taking gui that works with a git repo of markdown files. It's pretty cool.
