## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
My goals are to get an internal project I've picked back up this week, ready for data entry by monday. I've got the invite user flow finished for it. I need to do some QA on data access, and I think that's pretty much it. I'd also like to get some small refactors done, as I am trying to keep the tech debt low on this and try to keep the good repo patterns going, as I've learned that Claude really likes to just build some stuff without following the prevailing patterns and the longer you let the LLM break the pattern the more difficult the good patterns are to follow.]

### What are my challenges today?
Another goal I have is to build a template repo for setting up SupaBase for a project, :bulb: I wonder if there is already a starter repo out their for this exact thing. so many people do these open-source things for getting started and even if they don't, maybe I could make that and share it. My first time using something like this is when I uses the Figma make to local starter repo I found on github. What was that called? [likang/figma-make-local-runner](https://github.com/likang/figma-make-local-runner)

Anyways I am putting this in this section, because I want to do this, but is this really what I should be working on? I did just remember a principle of Lean manufacturing "should I even be doing this at all"  We can optimize tasks all day long, but before we optimize a task we should think, "should I even be doing this at all" By thinking that I thought of the idea to look for an open-source repo of this exact thing, as a starter. If I end up doing this, and that exists I will have saved myself heaps of time.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
I learned this the other day but in vimmium (vim for the browser) if you hit `yy` in normal mode it will yank (copy) the URL of the active tab, this is super useful when say you want to add a link to the repo you found for `Figma Make` and want to share it in your journal. :zany:
