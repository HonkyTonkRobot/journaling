## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
My goals are to get an internal project I've picked back up this week, ready for data entry by monday. I've got the invite user flow finished for it. I need to do some QA on data access, and I think that's pretty much it. I'd also like to get some small refactors done, as I am trying to keep the tech debt low on this and try to keep the good repo patterns going, as I've learned that Claude really likes to just build some stuff without following the prevailing patterns and the longer you let the LLM break the pattern the more difficult the good patterns are to follow.]

### What are my challenges today?
Another goal I have is to build a template repo for setting up SupaBase for a project, :bulb: I wonder if there is already a starter repo out their for this exact thing. so many people do these open-source things for getting started and even if they don't, maybe I could make that and share it. My first time using something like this is when I uses the Figma make to local starter repo I found on github. What was that called? [likang/figma-make-local-runner](https://github.com/likang/figma-make-local-runner)

Anyways I am putting this in this section, because I want to do this, but is this really what I should be working on? I did just remember a principle of Lean manufacturing "should I even be doing this at all"  We can optimize tasks all day long, but before we optimize a task we should think, "should I even be doing this at all" By thinking that I thought of the idea to look for an open-source repo of this exact thing, as a starter. If I end up doing this, and that exists I will have saved myself heaps of time.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Achieved!! It was a solid day of productivity. Got the project in production and ready for real data. It's definitely MVP, but ready to test and fix as we go.

### What have I learned today?
I learned this the other day but in vimmium (vim for the browser) if you hit `yy` in normal mode it will yank (copy) the URL of the active tab, this is super useful when say you want to add a link to the repo you found for `Figma Make` and want to share it in your journal. :zany:

I learned about useOptimistic a react hook for essentially printing the change instantly without waiting for the db refresh, but if the db fails it roles back the change. I replacement for useEffect in a lot of cases. Not sure the in's and out's yet, but discovery is the first step and a thing I am loving about using AI agents is it helps me discover stuff.

I'm stoked for how fast I am getting at telling when Claude is losing the plot, and resetting the changes made, killing claude and starting again. It happens more often than I'd like but it's helpful to be able to see when it's going off the rails. Definitely not keen on just letting Claude roam free. Also, Anthropic just realeased a cool feature that you can add prompts mid thinking. ie. if you see Claude going rogue, you can add more to the prompt and get Claude to course correct without having to stop the thinking. It just incorporates the thinking.

## Journal
New challenge just dropped _I'll see myself out_

I'm an entrepreneur at heart and am always thinking about business and growth. I definetely bring the owners mindset to work with me. Anyways I've been thinking about wanting to start a company in a few years, assuming an idea finds me. I've been thinking about guiding principles in a business, and reflecting on the work environments that inspire me, and the ones that were terrible.

#### Company Principles

1. **Remove the mundane, to focus on the insane.** a colorful way of saying, constantly remove the tedious so your brain can focus on the hard problems that deliver value to the customer
2. **One thing at a time** figuring out how to go fast is figuring out all of the things your not going to do. One thing shipped is better than 3 things in progress.
3. **Speak up** We have a northstar, If we are going off course it's your responsibility to say something.
4. **High trust, High expectations** I'll treat you like an adult, and you'll act like an adult
5. **ship it before it's ready** It is never done, but we only no what is important when users are using it.

That's maybe two to many, I like the idea of 3. Easy to remember, less is more mentality, so I'll keep working on it.
