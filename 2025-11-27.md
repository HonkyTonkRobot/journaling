## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- Create a new Supabase instance for the staging/preview deployment so it's not using the prod database. Not a problem when you there are no real users, but next week there will be new users.
- pair with my mentoring colleague.


### What are my challenges today?
Catching up on the work I need to finish. Especially sense there is a plan to pair. Sometimes it's faster, and sometimes it's slower. We'll see.
