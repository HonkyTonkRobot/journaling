## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goal today is to finish two tickets today on what was supposed to be my focus this week. it's been a big week of context switching among the 3 projects I am a part of maintaining, and one bonus project that I was brought in on to finish an urgent task.


### What are my challenges today?
Compared to the rest of the week, not much. Today will be about getting a true day of focus.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I finished one of the two tickets though. I spent a lot of time going through, the code refactoring it, and really pleased with the output. Also first time writing a script that's a TypeScript file instead of a `.sh` file. I did get started on the second ticket too, but still in the planning phase. one big learning I have had, is to spend a majority of your time in the planning


### What have I learned today?

#### relative paths vs path aliases
I refreshed my memory on relative paths and path alias / module alias. relative paths are the ones like ./../path/name.js  and path alias are like @path/from/specified/location  these get configured in the tsconfig.json and you can specify different ones
```
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "paths": {
        "@shared/*": ["./shared/*"],
        "@/*": ["./client/src/*"]
      }
    }
  }

```
Basically this just says when you see @shared/a/path  go to `./shared/a/path

I like the way Claude put it not ../../../ hell, also means it's easier to refactor with out creating a mess of the imports, and it makes things more readable.

#### eslint config no-undef rule

## Journal
I'm really excited to experiment with this new found energy to try and do two builds at once. I played around with container-use a few weeks back, and quite couldn't get it to run parrallel agents on two different git worktrees, but I will try again (not today) just still with good old git worktrees for today. container-use is an open-source project from Dagger which is a founded by the same people who create Docker. So it utilizes docker to spin up containerized branchs on different worktrees so that you can have two parrallel agents that aren't trying to compete with each other, and to keep feature branches seperate.

I've got a lot to learn but diving deeper into ai coding has been a really aazing journey.

Also, in the two weeks I wasn't journalling I met up with a friend Paul who taught me about using OBS effectively to share my learnings through video. So I'm really excited to start filming these things I am learning, instead of only writing about them. I think I'll start once my family has left.
