## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Create a stripe flow for users without a profile, to be able to buy a course and have their profiles auto-generated. Hoping for more pairing time, and I am also itching to do some refactoring. I know that is the whole that developers often fall into is the love of making the code base perfect :rofl: it's just satisfying to make it more readable, maintainable, etc. It's not a bad thing it just has to be managed.

### What are my challenges today?
I think maybe carving out sometime for the things I want to do. so we will see. If I can get that.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutely! got a really complex feature done with a Stripe integration. I did rely heavily on `Claude Code` for this feature as we are under the pump on this project. So I am keen to study up on the implementation over the weekend or next week, to get a better understanding of the stripe integration. I also got 3 hours of refactoring in, which was mostly just DRY'ing out the app. There were a bunch of duplicate logic, constants, UI components, React components. It felt quite good to clean up the code base a bit. I'd like to do more today, but I reckon I've gotta get back to finishing the last few features before this product launches to live users. Also, excited for it.


### What have I learned today?
Learned is hard one on this. I learned the power of process with AI agents, my new "2 second improvements" sped up my workflow tremendously. The other AI workflows and sub-agents our team has built out over time, when followed increase the chances of the output your are wanting, which a lot less time fighting it, and when I reduce the fighting, it usually means the code quality is cleaner and I do less refactoring to get it ready for PR and team review.

## Journal
Another day, of success on the Te Reo Māori and exercise fronts. Did a body weight workout during lunch. Though I think I've pulled a muscle in my leg, so running might be out for a week or so :(

I have forgotten to do my two second improvements for the last few months. Yesterday I finally got back on the horse and made some improvements to my AI workflow. I created three new `/` slash commands for my terminal coding environments, Claude code, Codex, and Gemini (though I never use Gemini).

### New slash commands
1. /write-issue
    - I can use this command for drafting a new issue that I can then refine. Basically all this command does is tell Claude my issue formatting rules. After the command I then brain dump everything I can think about regarding my thinking on the feature. Then I can work through a few steps refining it, but i don't have to write out my preferred formatting rules every single time, or muddy up the claude.md file with something that only really applies to this specific task.
2. /create-issue
    - I love this command, because I have a lot of hand written instructions for this action. I get it to add the issue to the repo, then add it to a specific project associated with the repo, then put it in a certain column, assign me as the user, give it a priority, and attach labels. All of this stuff can be done from GitHub CLI, which is amazing, but the commands are quite complex and It's a pain to write them out manually, Also the way you do this is not intuitive because it works using codes attached to things. ie. to add it to a column you have to put the column ID instead of the name, like what the hell is that. So I have this create-issue check to see if this are in the Claude.md file and if not it adds them so the next issue I create for the project it can just get on with it and not have to look up all of the random id's for stuff. Saves so much time, even when using AI tools.
3. /create-branch
    - this one I really enjoy too, I like to use the create branch from issue feature of GitHub, and it means I have to get out of my coding flow go to GitHub and make the branch. I like this feature because it connects the branch to the ticket, so when the PR get's merged into the main branch it auto closes the issue. Again this can be one using the gh CLI tool. so this slash command creates the branch and then checks it out for me, saving me 20-30 seconds at least.

All in all, These commands are like 20 "2 second improvements" that I created in an hour. Maybe it makes up for my lack of improvements to my process over the last month.

I am not sure if i've talked about the "2 second improvements" philosphy much before, but it never hurts to remind myself why I do it. I am the type of person that hates doing the same tedious thing over and over. I'm like a weird kind of lazy, I try to automate away as much of the boring parts of my work as possible, this is probably due to my ADHD brain (recently diagnosed). I will avoid tedium for interesting all day long. Unfortunately, in work there is a lot of tedius stuff that has to get done, so finding ways to minimize them is very helpful for me. I guess that's the "why" for my use of the "2 second improvement" idea.

### compounding effects
If I create a 2 second improvement every day for a year I will have saved myself ~37 hours, that's nearly a week of work, and then the cumulation for year two is ~148 hours so it just keeps scaling. Now, as things change you will adopt new processes making old processes obselete, and those two second improvements will be lost, but I think of it like entropy. The idea that the universe is getting more chaotic. And work is always getting more chaotic and I must manage this by making improvements to my process so I can continue to manage more and more things or I might just go up in smoke :fire: and burnout, or lose time with my family to get my work done or other side effects I'm missing.
