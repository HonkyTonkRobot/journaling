## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today are to the gh issue I have been working on which is a script that we will run as a cron job.


### What are my challenges today?



## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I mostly reached my goals. This is coming a week later as I have been on vacation all week, and never finished this journal, but I had gotten to the final bit of the script implementation, and after being gone and coming back to find it had been merged in and there were 0 changes after being reviewed by my boss feels good. I focused and did my best to produce good code, and feel validated that it has already been put into production and has been used by the team all week while I was on vacation.


### What have I learned today?
I understand the function of a cron job, though today I took time to understand it, and just learn about it.

A Cron job is a scheduled task on Unix-like systems (linux, macOS servers) that run automatically at specified times or intervals Cron runs in the background and operations scheduled with cron, are executed automatically making cron useful for automating maintenance-related tasks. [^1]

## Journal
I work for a company that is fully remote, they pay for me to have time in a coworking space if I want, so I do that a dozen days a month, and I can make my own hours so If I need to be somewhere in the middle of the day I can go, and then work in the evening or on the weekend. It's really something I could never have imagined in my previous role.

Started learning more about cron jobs, but didn't make the time to document them. I have linked to the resources I was using to learn more about cron jobs. This will be an on ongoing learning.
