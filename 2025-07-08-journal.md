## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [ ] Goals today are finishing updating our type system to have proper seperation of concerns. Seperating out the Domain data for app specific data (ie. UserData), DB entities to extend the Domain data interface (ie. User), and Domain transfer Object interface extensions for various CRUD operations (ie. UpdateUserData).
- [ ] Research zod to determine how to best make use of it.
- [ ] MAIN GOAL: Finish getting the db <-> frontend fully piped and operational


### What are my challenges today?
I'd say my challenges today, are not knowing what I don't know. I am finding that as a junior dev, I will get into what I think the problem is and then find myself debugging something unexpected. A side effect of the changes I've made. Fortunately I have a great team that is very helpful at coaching me through problems we I need help.
