## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get the next ticket done on the new project.


### What are my challenges today?



## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Today was hectic, I though Tuesday was going to be hectic but it turned out today was the one. Previous client had missing requirements from the prd that we were trying to get done as they were already using it. Which meant working double duty to get that and my new projects work done. It all happened, but yea it was hectic, and left me frustrated. These things happen and you push through, but it sucked.

### What have I learned today?
reenforced learning that thrash in your work is painful. Got more experience working in a team project, we work mostly solo but some projects will have 2-3 people on them, and it's fun navigating feature integration, as we mostly do git flow. When working by myself I follow more of a trunk based flow. It was also weird having 3 branches open with 2 of them having PR's so I was adding features completely seperate features but having to navigate if they would end up with merge conflicts as they were getting merged in.

## Journal
Really excited for this new to me project, as it's a different tech stack than all of the other projects I've been working on. All of the other projects have used TypeScript, Next.js, Supabase, and this one uses TypeScript, React.js, React-query, express, drizzle, and render.com for the postgreSQL db. which are mostly all things I learned in Dev Academy so go to flex those muscles and practice getting into an established codebase and figuring out what is going on.
