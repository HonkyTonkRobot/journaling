## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Solve this RLS problem around recursion and then get on with finishing off the RLS policies I am working on.


### What are my challenges today?
Challenges are time boxing, and getting it as good as I can. This is just a tough one, because I can't leave it undone. RLS is kind of important. And although yesterday I did a pretty good job of not chasing rabbits, I am striving for an even better output today.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
