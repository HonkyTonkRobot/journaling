**Title:** Celebrating wins
**Date:** 2025-05-09
**Author:** Joel Anderson
**Description:** I have just returned from a nice celebratory family vacation. It was nice to be with family and to enjoy that time together, after what was a long and fairly intense 17-week bootcamp. I've missed a few journal entries over the last week, but that's ok. The goal is not perfection but persistence.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Complete this Journal, set my plans for next week, and write one tiny line of code.

### What are my challenges today?
Challenges today include my headspace. I've received some bad news, and it is weighing heavily on my mind today. I'm trying to go easy on myself today.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Not really as I am completing this journal 3 days later. I did set my plans for next week (this week). I'm going to continue on this project, as I didn't really get much coding in over the vacation. I did not achieve writing one tiny piece of code, but I'm celebrating recognizing that and today is a new day, that won't be affected by that.

### What have I learned today?
I'd say I reinforced as opposed to learned that persistence over perfect is the key to success. Not every day is going to be a knockout success.
