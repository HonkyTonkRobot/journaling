## Journal
I have been trying to think about what I want my learning goals to be for work this coming 90 days. I am not really sure what those should be.

## 90 Day ~~sprint~~marathon? goals
### Continue my Te Reo Māori learning
    - Find someone to practice with
    - Sign-up for a course
    - double down on vocab growth, especially workplace vocab.

### Find a software development learning goal
I'm starting to thing I should make it a side project. I've had a few on my mind.
    - A kitchen management app has been on my mind
    - Also, a flashcard game for my kid.
    - More recently I've started developing a Te Reo Māori first keyboard which I could turn into an open-source project, could use this as an opportunity to figure out how to make this more widely available to people.
    - I was also considering making some kind of Te Reo Learning game for "a" and "o" possesive in te reo as this is a really challenging thing in Te Reo and was very surprised not to find one that already existed.
