description: Full sending Regolith today. It's going to be painful, but it's the only way to do it.
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- Get my settings finished in Regolith
- Get a new feature added to an older client project.
- Refactor, data flow on the current project. I really took the MVP model seriously on this one, which created some tech debt, and wasn't as DRY as I would have liked but, now doing the refactor is so satisfying, and can tell it's already having an improvement on functionality.


### What are my challenges today?
Regolith, it's already painful having my familiar keyboard navigation not working from my Ubuntu gnome setup. So that will definitely slow progress.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
- I wouldn't say they are finished, but I've fully switched to Regolith, and then will have plenty of two second improvements for the foreseable future. One thing I'm already loving about regolith is I have a config file for keyboard mapping, so I can do a lot more, than what I could do in ubuntu.
- new feature done in under an hour merged into the production site. That felt good
- finished refactoring the types but never got to refactoring the data flow, but there were a lot more type issues I had to work through than I initially thought.

### What have I learned today?
That regolith is awesome. I even created a vim mode so that I can navigate windows like vim, and then enter insert mode to start typing in what ever window I am in, means I don't have to keep pressing the mod/super key everytime I want a shortcut.
