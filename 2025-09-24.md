description: Full sending Regolith today. It's going to be painful, but it's the only way to do it.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- Get my settings finished in Regolith
- Get a new feature added to an older client project.
- Refactor, data flow on the current project. I really took the MVP model seriously on this one, which created some tech debt, and wasn't as DRY as I would have liked but, now doing the refactor is so satisfying, and can tell it's already having an improvement on functionality.


### What are my challenges today?
Regolith, it's already painful having my familiar keyboard navigation not working from my Ubuntu gnome setup. So that will definitely slow progress.


## End of Day
