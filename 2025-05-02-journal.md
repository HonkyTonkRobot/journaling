## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Todays goals
1. Move Dev Academy Project Instances over to my GitHub
  - Update their README's with Links to my teammates GitHub's, and talk about what I did on the project.
  - Add Project links on my Blog If I have time.
2. Time Block everything out for the day
3. Finish Interview question prep :sweat_smile:

### What are my challenges today?
Not getting distracted, staying diligent on the task at hand. I've got a lot of things to do and my mind is swimming a bit. Will likely have more than one 5min meditation session to keep the mind focused.
## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
2 out of 3. I ran out of time for the Interview prep questions. Not because I didn't follow my time blocks, but because I didn't plan for unexpected family stuff.

### What have I learned today?
1. I've learned, It's ok if unexpected things block you from following your time blocks, so it's good to always have some time in your week for unexpected things.
2. I also learned there's a README.md generator for your profile readme.
3. I also learned how to clone a repo down and then set a new remote branch.
  - `git remote -v` to check the current remote repo's
  - `git remote add <new-remote> <URL>` add new remote repo
  - `git remote remove <remote-name>` remove a remote repo
  - `git remote rename <remote-name> <new-remote-name>` rename a remote repo


## Journal
I feel great about today, I was able to get most of my goals, and It made feel good about what I have achieved so far. It also showed me where I have some stuff I can improve upon. Just looking back the project I feel like I can seem some stuff that I can do to really make the projects stand out.

Today is the last day of Dev Academy, and though I am a bit sad it's over as I've made some really great connections through this process, and learned heaps. I am excited about what comes next! Some more hard work, that hopefully results in a job.
