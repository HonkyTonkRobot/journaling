## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Todays goals
1. Move Dev Academy Project Instances over to my GitHub
  - Update their README's with Links to my teammates GitHub's, and talk about what I did on the project.
  - Add Project links on my Blog If I have time.
2. Time Block everything out for the day
3. Finish Interview question prep :sweat_smile:
### What are my challenges today?
Not getting distracted, staying diligent on the task at hand. I've got a lot of things to do and my mind is swimming a bit. Will likely have more than one 5min meditation session to keep the mind focused.
