## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Figure out what the next feature up is for the day, knock it out. Tomorrow is going to be a day of manual QA, really trying to put the app through it's paces, and then Friday will be tidying any bugs we find. :fingers_crossed: That the list is short.


### What are my challenges today?
Challenges today, will be staying focused on getting MVP for launch, when all my brain wants to do is refactor.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
My AI "2 second improvements" were an absolutely game changer in my workflow yesterday. I have identified two more that I'm going to do today

1. /create-pr - this one will use my formatting rules to create a pr for the feature/refactor/hot-fix branch I am working on. I may also make a `/write-pr` to write the draft, but I think this is a bit less important as there is already lot of documentation and git diff for informing the pr creation process, unlike the issue draft which needs a bit more back and forth to nail the scope and context needed for starting the planning phase.
2. /commit - I should have made this one first, as this is the thing that, I keep having to remind claude code how to do, and annoys me to no end. Another great saying by Paul Ackers the person who popularized the version of lean manufacturing called "2 Second Lean" is "fix what bugs you" This is a sure fire way to get the dopamine hit that often comes from making process improvements. And also, just makes life better.
