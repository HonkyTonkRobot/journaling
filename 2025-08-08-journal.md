description: I don't talk about my daily improvements enough. I'm thinking to add a heading for what I improved today, but I like to keep things simple, simplicity is easier to maintain, despite the never ending battle with entropy.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Well today is the last day to get work done before things go live on Monday. So, I know of one very important ticket that needs to be completed around accessability. This is a ticket I am very excited about, because it's an important topic and learning more about how this stuff works is important.
- I want to submit a talk topit to the NZ Tech Ralley speaker submissions. Just typing that I want to do it has me getting nervous and uncomfortable, which let's me know I should definitely be doing it.

### What are my challenges today?
Getting my work done before the deadline, it's going to be an exciting day.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I have 8 minutes over time, but it felt great getting my PR in, it was small, I thoroughly understood what I had done, I feel like I made some meaningful improvements, and even had time to give a brief run down of the changes to my colleague.

The other goal reached today was actually finishing my journal on the same day! which was great because I was able to share my learnings about URLSearchParams something I would have 100% not been able to as clearly recall on Monday.

### What have I learned today?
1. URLSearchParams - a built-in JS class for building query strings

for example for a youtube video if you want to set certain params for how your embeded YouTube video works you could do
```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  autoplay: '0',
  cc_load_policy: '1',
  hl: 'en',
})
```
then you can call different methods from the params instance of the class.
```js
params.set('autoplay', '1') // changes the value of a key=value pair
params.get('hl') // returns "en" or the value of "hl"
params.delete('cc_load_policy') //removes this parameter from the the object with the quoted key
params.toString() // this chains all of the key=value pairs together formatted for a URL.
```

In this video URL we are using it to call toString() which auto-magically adds all of the `&`, `?`, and `%20` encodings the url needs to work properly. This is great for futureproofing because if you need to come in and change something you don't have to go and hunt down hardcoded strings and manually change them all. you just change it here, and then everywhere this instance of the class is called will follow the new rules.

I'm starting to understand this stuff more as I learn more about OOP.

## Journal
Improvements today :thinking:

Well I didn't make any today, but I have been thinking about an nvim plugin that will give me a diff of my current branch and the branch I want to merge into, because I have really been enjoying reviewing my code in split mode on github. It's really helpful for my own review of my work before I ask a coworker to review it. All that being said I'd love to be able to do it in my terminal and not have to switch to the browser. even just have a terminal tab with the diff on it that I can switch back and forth to as I need to.

I found one called diffview.nvim which looks pretty good. So I'll say my imrpovement today was finally getting around to searching and finding one. Thanks for the prompt journal :rofl:
