description: I don't talk about my daily improvements enough. I'm thinking to add a heading for what I improved today, but I like to keep things simple, simplicity is easier to maintain, despite the never ending battle with entropy.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Well today is the last day to get work done before things go live on Monday. So, I know of one very important ticket that needs to be completed around accessability. This is a ticket I am very excited about, because it's an important topic and learning more about how this stuff works is important.
- I want to submit a talk topit to the NZ Tech Ralley speaker submissions. Just typing that I want to do it has me getting nervous and uncomfortable, which let's me know I should definitely be doing it.

### What are my challenges today?
Getting my work done before the deadline, it's going to be an exciting day.
