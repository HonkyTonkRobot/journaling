## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Finish off my list of bugs.


### What are my challenges today?
Following my timeboxing and using them for a guide of when to MVP it or to keep improving it.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I got so close to finishing the list, but the last bug, was just not wanting to be found. In the end I found it, and fixed half of it, with a clear path for finishing the rest today.


### What have I learned today?
I got some practice working on getting it working before refactoring. Often I think I overthink things and make them more complicated than needed, but today I was on a mission to solve all of the bugs. So I had to be quick. Which meant I was going for quick solutions, understanding their drawbacks, and continuing forward, instead of going overboard on the refactoring of the things I found along the way that weren't the day's priority. Also, gave me a great opportunity to document what I did find. make new tickets, so that these other things I found wouldn't be forgotten.
