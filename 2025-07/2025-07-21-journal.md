description: It's a new week. we have a couple of projects on, will be jumping on what's on top but not sure what that is based on where the rest of the team got up to.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Keep cracking away a setting up `Supabase` RLS on a project. This is my 3 time setting up, everytime just learning that little bit more. It feels really good. I feel like this is the part of software dev. that I am getting the most confident in. I had a little bit of experience with SQL so it's coming more naturally, but more around the learning of deploying a db through `Supabase`


### What are my challenges today?
I think staying focus on speed, and not over optimizing from the start. As a person who is interested in startups and moving quickly is gaining a deeper understanding of technical debt, and talking to our senior developers about what trade offs to make to move quickly get it in front of customers and once the feature is validated then refactoring.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Definitely not, but I am going to celebrate my wins. I found a not relevant bug in my code and instead of chasing the rabbit down the hole, I decided to document it in a github issue using the `GitHub CLI` tool. Which if you don't know about it's incredible. you can make issues, add them to your project kanban, assign it. you make PR requests on your feature branches. And with Claude code it's even more incredible because you can get it done for you without having to remember all the flags you need, but you gotta be careful as you probably know LLM's can be pretty verbose in their writing.I recently learned a technique from the `The Startup Podcast` about AI prompting, to use the simple phase `Hemmingway rules` and it drasitically cuts down on the filler words.

### What have I learned today?
I learned about cryptographically writing values to JWT sessions, to prevent recursive behavior when you start implementing RLS in `SupaBase` though not sure I quite learned enough because after nearly 8 hours of trying to get it done, I got it working and then my whole system broke, then went through a whole debugging session, and it turns out I just needed to "Turn it off on and on again" ie. `npx supabase stop` > `npx supabase start` once I spun the docker containers down and up again, it started working, but the sad news is through my debugging I decided to reset to a few commits back, and lost about 2 hours of progress. All that to say, it has stopped working again, so I think their is a deeper problem, that I need to continue to debug or change course. In previous projects, I've used RLS bypass functions that allow elevated users like admin the ability to skip past RLS policies, but I learned that while that (according to Claude) was a **** for security using this JWT technique was a ***** technique. :man_shrugging: who knows. Another day, another problem to solve and learn from!
