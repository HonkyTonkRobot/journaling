description: I've been working as an Junior dev for over a month now, and thought it would be a good time to reflect on being a junior dev in an AI assitant forward company.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today, are to continue with the refactor unless I get put onto a different project of need. I'd like to complete it for sure, but there is a lot to do.

### What are my challenges today?
Balancing concerns of completion, and learning.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I can't even remember :laughing: It's been another week where I start a journal at the beginning of the week, and end the entry on a Friday. I have achieved the things I have needed to this week so It's a win for the week.


### What have I learned today?
I learned a lot this week. I've gotten more familiar with deployment to Vercel. How to setup a monorepo with different apps, and how to use the `vercel cli` to deploy those to different production environments. I've learned about an internal AI scraping tool we've built, and how to use it to gather data, and return it with structured output. REally interesting seeing how tools can be built, to put guardrails around the AI so you can use it's ability, but limit the downside of it's halucinations in theory at least.

I've learned how important it is to build your app after a major refactor :rofl: as if you don't do it, after a couple big changes, you find that your app no longer builds. That was fun :zany:.

Hmm, this is why I need to journal everyday. I'd like to be more specific as I journal instead of these broad strokes. Like I'd loke to talk more about learning the in's and out's of tsconfig.json, or `supabase/config.json` And what I've learned about using claude code in combination with the GitHub CLI, which is a crazy efficient way to create issues, and PR's.

I am really please that I am consistently getting a single journal entry after weeks on none, but I do have to desire to reach daily journals again. Next week is always another opportunity.

## Journal
It's been six weeks in my first job as a junior software developer. Up until this job, I had essentially not used AI to do any coding. I definitely used it to help me understand a problem, or to help me debug a problem, but I had never used it to help code. The company I have joined is extremely AI forward. We go way beyond just using an AI assistant like Cursor or Cline in our IDE. I think part of this is we are implementing AI in some of our client work, which has been pretty cool to start learning about.

Anyways, I'd like to talk about what it's like being a junior dev in an AI world. How this effects my learning, etc.

The answer is I don't know, because I don't know the alternative, I don't know what it looks like to learn on the job without it. What my exposure is to different things, and how I get an understanding, but I have some hunches.

#### My hunches
##### If I wasn't using AI as a junior developer
1. I'd probably be getting stuck on error messages way, way more (therefore I'd learn more about reading error messages)
2. I'd probably get really good at spotting bugs, syntax errors
3. I'd probably get to know a really thin sliver of the work my company works on, but I'd get to know it quite deeply.
4. I'd have deep knowledge around one project

##### and how I think it contrasts working with AI
1. I don't really fuss about the error messages I get, I ask AI to explain it to me, to find the problem break down why it's happening, and to give me a plan to solve the problem.
2. I don't really think about syntax errors, between LSPs, Linting tools, and AI code analysis.
  - Though I do think I am still getting good at spotting bugs, but not in the same way, It's more of an intuition that because I am seeing lots of similar files and design patterns I am quickly starting to see what the good patterns and bad patterns look like, and even though my understanding is still quite naive, my lizard brain is starting go wait a minute that looks funny, and then I can get AI to break it down for me, or if I want to get a deep understanding I use it to help me find resources on the topic.
3. I think my really deep understanding of how the code works is probably not locked in. What I mean is I am learning these things, but because they aren't hard won battles of the mind, they aren't getting locked in. Like when you beat your head against the table trying to solve a problem, and then you figure it out, you don't forget what you learned, but when you ask AI what this problem is and it explains it you go oh yea, I get it, and you move on, but then you have forgotten it by the time you see the problem again or your solving a similar problem.
  - 3.1 I think where the mindshift has to happen is it's not about understanding the problem fully when you see it anymore, it's about familiarity, and being able to tell when something stinks. I may be looking at this in a kind of way that is colored because I work at software consultancy with many clients, but with AI I have the opportunity to get in tons of reps. Building apps from start to finish, over and over and over. What this means is I seem a lot of similar stuff. I know there's a lot of ways to bake a cake, but most people follow a recipe, and learn from others techniques on how to bake a good cake. Same thing here. I am doing the same things, seeing the same problems, over and over, which I'm already beginning to solve those problems before they happen because I know they are coming because I've seen them a few times. And it's crazy to think I've seen these problems a few times already. I've only been with the company for 6ish-7ish weeks.
4. This hunch I'm not sure how it will play out, because I'm thinking of my first project, where I worked on it front to back with the guidance of a senior developer, but I did all of the development with my synthetic friend Claude, and I feel like I really understand how the whole app works. Where we made trade  offs, how data flows from front to back. I would say I don't have that deep knowledge of how each particular function is working, but I understand what it's doing and understand the code when I read it which to me is the important thing. I reckon over time as I get more and more reps in I'll get stronger and stronger intuition. I think the learning is just different. Instead of getting really knowledgeable about a single slice really deeply, I am getting knowledgable about a wide slice very shallowly, but get the repitition of doing it over and over and over, getting a little deeper each time.

#### End of journal thoughts
I think I will learn things at the same rate as a non AI counterpart, but in a different way. I want get there faster, or maybe I will. It's hard to know because I've chosen this journey.
