## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals are to finish the refactor on the frontend.

### What are my challenges today?
Not getting stuck. yesterday was quite the trudge. It felt like I wasn't able to get into a flow state, and smash out work. It was constant stop start. normally I can carve out 3-4 hour blocks to really getting things done, but had a lot of interruptions (self imposed) and context switching, that I want to try and not repeat today.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Didn't finish the refactor, but stoked with the progress. I was able to really simplify the codebase by creating a reusable diaglog component, that has props past to it. Reduced nearly 200 lines of code from 6 different pages in the project.


### What have I learned today?
I have learned that RLS as can be a pain in the ass some times. I was getting some RLS policies that just would not work with what I am trying to do. I've got a pairing with our senior dev, so will take that opportunity to learn what the problem was, but spent entirely too much time trying to figure it out. I'm also rememebering as I type this how important time boxing is, to prevent wasting a day on a problem, when there are other problems that need solving too.
