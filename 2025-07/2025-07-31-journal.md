## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
I feel a bit aimless today. Not sure what the next ticket on my project is today. Will likely optimize for learning today.


### What are my challenges today?


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, it turned out that it was a super directed day, I was given the ticket of doing manual QA on a site that goes live next Friday. Super fun, strangly enough. i was able to find a bug, that was a challenge to solve but really fun. I felt like I was make progress through it. I found two of those so my morning and evening were both full.


### What have I learned today?
I learned quite a bit though this is the morning after so hopefully I can put on paper (screen?) what I learned.

I learned about using GitHub for git reviewing using the split view so you can see the code side by side, and how to comment on the code. ie. my co-worker was able to leave me comments, and help me make my code even better. And through that process I'm learning how to write better code. It also gave me a way to review my own code, and help me find things on my own that could have been better. I really would like to figure out if there's a Neovim, wezTerm, Z-shell way of doing the git branch side by side. because as super useful as it is to push it up, and review it, If I could do it in my terminal I'd like that even more.

I got better at using the GitHub CLI, I would say I learned anything except I can tell my memory is improving on the use of the CLI which is great. It keeps me in my terminal which is where I like to live.

I got more comfortable with implementing `React Query` The repo had been originally built without React Query, and we implemented React Query because for one thing it makes the code so much more readible. Anyways to bug I found hadn't been switched over to using ReactQuery and was still making direct db calls and was managing this with useState and useEffect, which were really not ideal considering this was in the page layout, and the children components were using the updated React Queries. This was causing the UI to not properly update in the layout until refresh.

I feel like I learned so much more but struggling to remember.

- When building a db query I learned how to use .order() and order_index for sorting the returned data.

Ok, gonna call it I can't remember. Though this is why I do this, it helps me consolidate my learning.
