## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Find and fix one more thing during the QA process. Also, I hope it gives me an opportunity to refactor something. I really enjoy the refactor process, I feel like it's teaching me how to write good code straight off the bat. though always keeping in the back of my head balencing moving quickly and writing maintainable code.


### What are my challenges today?
Maybe being time poor, I did a big 10 hour day yesterday, because OI couldnt leave until I finished that refactor and got a PR in for my colleague to review, so today I've only got 6 hours.

Also, not going too far down the rabbit hole. I am finding it hard to not go down the rabbit hole when I find an unrelated problem to the thing I am fixing. I'm trying to get into the practice of ducumenting it in an issue in the GitHub repo, but sometimes it's so hard to not just fix it. My brain goes it'll be a simple fix just do it. Then it ends up taking me two hours because I'm a junior so understanding the problem and making sure I understand the fix, is often quite time consuming.
