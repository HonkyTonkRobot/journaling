## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get through one of the exercises I have for the various things I am learning.

### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've been spending a lot of time playing around with configurations for my wezTerm and NeoVim setups over the last week, and am finding them as a distraction from learning :rofl:
Not sure I talked about that much last week as I missed a bunch of entries, but maybe I'll talk about it today after I've finished my exercises.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Not quite didn't finish the exercise. or get to the practice questions.

### What have I learned today?
- Process is a built-in Node.js global object
- And process.env is a node.js object with environment variables.
_I've seen and used these before in projects but realised I didn't know what they were._

- When a returning these object properties using an `!` point on the end is a TypeScript way of saying that it's Defintely defined so you don't need to do something like `string | undefined`

- In PSQL the `::` operator is used to type cast a value from one type to another. ie. if you have a float like 3.5::int this would get converted to an integer like 3 as it drops the fractional part.

- I remember learning about JWT to decrypt a JWT, but had fun testing that out on my anon token for supabase today using [JWT.io](https://jwt.io)
