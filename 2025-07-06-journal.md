## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get through one of the exercises I have for the various things I am learning.

### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've been spending a lot of time playing around with configurations for my wezTerm and NeoVim setups over the last week, and am finding them as a distraction from learning :rofl:
Not sure I talked about that much last week as I missed a bunch of entries, but maybe I'll talk about it today after I've finished my exercises.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?
