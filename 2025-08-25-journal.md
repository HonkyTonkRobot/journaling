## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
complete a new feature request for a client so I can focus for the rest of the week.


### What are my challenges today?
maintaining strict timeboxing.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutely crushed it yesterday. Did 3 complete tickets yesterday. I get a high every time I complete an issue, and with a strong effort to keep tickets small, It means I am able to integrate new features into staging/production quickly. though what I am finding is the now my bottle next is getting a feature into staging/production because I am doing it more the weight of doing the pr's and code review, lint,format,build checks (hopefully one day integration testing) etc etc is becoming a huge time suck. This is why one piece flow or one thing at time is a great principle from Lean manufacturing, because it helps you uncover where the bottlenecks are, and the bottleneck is constantly moving.


### What have I learned today?
I learned about how to use `<Suspense></Suspense>` boundaries in React/Next.js for components that take longer to load. essentially it allows you to say, hey this is going to take awhile to load, so go ahead a load the rest of the page, and while this part is loading show a loading component, or show this "skeleton" component which is like a component that looks like a blurred out version of the real thing. Kind of like on social media pages, the posts, look like grey boxes and then they turn into pictures and messages once the page loads. Unless it's linkedIn and they take ages to load.

I learned about the dynamic variable in Next.js `const export dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

This is basically away to have server data fetching in server-side html rendering, so it get's pre-rendered with the data, and then served, which is good for these reasons given to me by claude

  **Why this is optimal:**
  • Security: Data fetching happens server-side with full auth context
  • Performance: Data is pre-rendered, no loading states needed
  • SEO: Fully rendered HTML sent to browser
  • Simplicity: No client-side loading/error states to manage

  Decision matrix:

  | Use Case                   | Best Approach                     | Why                        |
  |----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
  | Admin pages with auth data | force-dynamic                     | Security + performance     |
  | Public pages               | Default (auto)                    | Let Next.js optimize       |
  | Highly interactive pages   | 'use client' + API routes         | Better UX for interactions |
  | Real-time data             | 'use client' + polling/websockets | Data changes frequently    |

#### Supabase postgREST
This is supercool, still diving in and learning more, but I can already see some really great ways of using it to access the database efficiently. especially for getting filtered results from a table. I discovered this because Claude suggested it for a particular task I had. I haven't implemented it yet, because I haven't had the time to read the docs, but from the little bit of digging I did do I can see how useful it is. The more I learn about Supabase the more I realize i don't know about it. It's just extremely powerful, they will have me so bought in, It will be hard to every switch.

## Journal
I just want to say again how much I love squash and merge. Though I follow the convention of naming branches `issues/NN/name-of-issue`  and then when I get to the squash and merge I think for the squash and merge instead of leaving the default branch name it pulls in as the merge commit changing it to the `<type>(<name>): <message>` format of commits.

Another day of not finishing my journal same day, but I am trying to lean out the week, as I'm working 10 hour days so I can take friday off for the Rust confrence happening this weekend :raised_hands:
