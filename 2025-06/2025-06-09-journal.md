## Journal
I'm going to skip everything else as I am writing this at 8pm on a Monday night.

A few of the things I learned.
The Next.js app file structure. naming directories with parenthesis allows you to organize it into folders that don't end up in the route. `(auth)` or how you can use brackets for setting up params in the route. `/app/users/[id]` I found this method weird at annoying that I had a million files called `page.tsx` but not that I've been working in it for a week I get it.

It's funny when I first started learning React, typescript, and the various other JS libraries we learned in Dev Academy, I was stressed by the idea of having to go learn a different framework. Now that I am out of the course for a little over a month, and I have already dabbled in a few different programming languages, and now learning a different JavaScript framework I am realizing, that's it's not that stressful picking up a new tool, and in fact it's just the way of the industry.

I can see how getting a lot of time on one is valuable as it teaches you something at a deep level, and I am very excited about that too. I'm starting to see why people like next.js and why it is becoming more popular.

I am still learning about the server side rendering works, and that's what I am doing tonight is studying that a little bit.

I probably learned this before but just learned that a functions in JS are objects, so just like any object you attach a property to it through `.` notation

So you could have
```
function MyComponent() {}
MyComponent.displayName = "CustomName"
```
and this would assign the value `CustomerName` to the displayName key in MyComponent.
