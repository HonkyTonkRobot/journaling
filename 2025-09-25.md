## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
I'm not sure, hopefully get some feedback on yesterdays work from the team and have a clear picture of what's on top today.

### What are my challenges today?
It's always difficult coming in without a focus for the day. It can go well, and sometimes it can be ddifficult to find where to direct my energy. What's the most important thing to the business. I think I know what to do, but, I'm keen to hear from the team.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
Yesterday was a fun day, I finally made the wholesale switch to Regolith swayland, and I'm loving it. because you can really customize the keybindings, I've been able to make vim mode that allows me to truly navigate the windows like vim and when I want to start using a window I can switch back to "insert" mode. It's been a bit funny as I've got to retrain my brain a bit from being quite used to the keymaps on the Ubuntu system which are pretty similar to what you would find on any computer, with lots of super key, and ctrl key action. I spent entirely to much time working on it yesterday so maybe in was a 30 second improvement, and a 1 minute step backwards in my efficiency :laughing:. That also means I didn't log a full 8hrs of work yesterday, but I had already banked a couple of 9hr days so it felt ok to be able to spend some time playing with my system.

### What I appreciate about my job
I love the atomomy I am given. My bosses motto is I treat you like an adult, you act like an adult, and he lives that. It means I feel really motivated not to break that trust and to deliver the results that are expected of me. Another great aspect is that we have the flexibility to pick our own hours, which is really helpful when you have a kid. I can design my life a bit easier because of this. Also, I thought I would hate working remote but we have some great team culture, and utilize Discord well, which means we have a lot of face time with each other, and instead of standup we have a check in which is just a great way for us to build relationships as a team.

The outher thing that is huge from me is having senior team members that really want to support my growth. It was one of things I wanted in my first job as a junior developer was mentorship. I feel extremely lucking and am thankful that I found such a wonderful team.
