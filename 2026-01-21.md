## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Still crushing out a huge backlog of mostly tiny fixes. Some of them have turned out to be more complicated than expected.

### What are my challenges today?
Time boxing. I want to pick out the smallest tickets I can progress them as far as I can in 2hrs and then move on to the next one.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutely crushed through three refactors today (mostly UI/frontend stuff) including full coverage testing on all of the code I touched.

### What have I learned today?
I am learning more about how to work well within a big team as my current project has quite a few stakeholders to interact with when working on tickets. Learning (ako) to reach out immediately with a question (pātai), as by the time I am "done" (mutu) planning (whakaaro) the answer (whakautuutu) may have arrived (tae mai)

## Journal
I've been very busy outside my work life. I built a bed and a bench. Great to get back into furniture making after a long (roa) break.

### 90 day goals
1. I have signed up to a night class for Te Reo Māori!!! Super excited about that
    - I've also been progressing my te reo Māori keyboard layout, which I have foundly found the setup I like that has the fewest bigraphs (sequential same finger presses) and passes the vibes test. It just feels natural and comfortable. Also, surprisingly has had no effect on my ability to type with the Qwerty keyboard layout that I use for english. I think this is because it's a bit of a mind switch When I am typing a te reo word it's like my brain switches. I've been very diligent to only type te reo words in that layout and english words in my english layout. I want to lock in that muscle memory so that I really double down on that brain switching pattern that is showing up naturally. I've also created some pretty sweet keymaps that make it super fast to switch between the two different layouts, but I still forget sometimes and is pretty hilarious when I start trying to type in english and it's in the te reo format. I've already been able to get to a 55wpm typing speed which is an improvement over my qwerty typing speed for Te Reo (42wpm) My goal is to get it to my English typing speed which is 100-115wpm. I think it will be easier to achieve than with english as the qwerty is not an ideal keyboard setup, but I don't want to learn a different setup.

2. My other 90 goals are to finish some house work. I Just finishing repairing a bbq grill in my backyard, and making a new bed frame, and a bench seat for our front hallway so we can sit to change shoes. I'm also mid process on some painting so need to finish that. Then, I've got a huge yard project to fix our rotten planter beds that are probably 30 years old. the list goes on. I want to get this all done before summer has fully gone and it's rain season :/

This is supposed to be my journal about my coding journal but at the moment I am quite settled in with my work, and recouping catching up in other places in my life before I make another big learning push.Also, this first 9 months has been an absolute whirlwind of learning.
