description: I love my job, because of the timing flexibility. I was sick on Wednesday, but instead of having to take a sick day, Which are valuable when you have a kid, I'm just able to make it up by pulling longer days, or by working a weekend day.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today, are to get get some smaller focus busting tasks out of the way so that when I log in on Monday, I can have some extreme focus around a new project I am starting. It the lighting speed we move at this company because of AI assistance is incredible. I'm already onto my fourth project in under 3 months. And were not building anything crazy but we are building some interesting websites and applications, that need custom solutions.


### What are my challenges today?
Getting the multiple tasks I need to complete done efficiently. There the kind of thing that you can get dragged down into one thing and let all the time get sucked up that was needed for the other tasks, so today will be important to do some timeboxing.
