title: 2 second improvement
Date: 2025-08-11
Author: Joel Anderson
description: I try and make a 2 second improvement to my process everyday. I think of it like fighting entropy. The work environment is getting more and more chaotic, causing more and more friction in getting work done. By making a 2 second improvement, which compounds everyday, reduces that friction so I can stay focused on the higher leverage tasks. If I can save seconds everytime I need to make a commit, the savings overtime is huge. If I can start this journal and already have a template to get started, I don't have to spend the congnative energy on setting up the journal again. The current set of improvements I am working on creating a richer git navigation in my terminal/neovim setup so that I can be more productive with git.
