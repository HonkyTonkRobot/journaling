## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goal's today :thinking:
I had a play with Figma Make last weekend, and my normal behavior is to do one thing from start to finish, but I am not optimizing for completeness here I am optimizing for learnings. I am learning things so fast, I feel like they are going in one ear and out the other. They are sticking after repetition. ie. i've worked on 3 projects with the exact same tech stack and implemented RLS on 3 different things and I remember all of those things. But, other learnings, that I am not seeing on every project or maybe I should be, but I've already forgotten them.

This is a lot of words to say, I learned that your github repo wiki, is actually it's own git hub repo, and you can visit your wiki repo, and clone it down, so you can edit it locally and push it up to your project. What I would like to do is start slowly building a play book, that I can upload to any project, and use it as reference, and have my ai assistants both on the coding end and on the pr review end, reference it, and hopefully make my coding even faster and more consistent, and it gives me a chance to consolidate the things I am learning in to a concise hopefully digestable document.

- [ ] Start building a starter wiki repo.

### What are my challenges today?
As always on the weekends. limited time. I've only got about 2 hours so we will see how much I get done.
