description: All about getting my code in for cv-share, a little bit about Code with JV course I'm taking
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get the downloads page working for cv-share and complete the mvp of this app.
2. attend Code with JV class at 10am

### What are my challenges today?
I think my challenges will be like most days staying focused. I've got a lot of things on my mind. Process improvement, applying for a few new jobs I've Identified, life admin that I've been putting off that really needs to be sorted.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutely! It was really rewarding to realize I had hit my goals.

### What have I learned today?
I have learned heaps, which is mostly listed in my Journal but heres the bullet points
- how to merge a branch into main without the most recent commit in the incoming branch.
- I learned about Aider, and it's NeoVIM plugin
- I practiced resetting the HEAD one commit back and then `--force` push so the remote branch also deletes the most recent commit
- I learned how to get a download to work from my github repo, though I imagine this isn't the ideal scenario for downloads.
- I also learned how to make a shape with just CSS and then also with Chakra-UI

## Journal
I just learned how to make a pull request for a branch but not including the most recent commit. It seems obvious after learning it. I just `git checkout -b <new-branch> HEAD~1` and then `git push origin <new-branch>` now I can pull request, merge, and delete this temp branch and get back to my other branch with the newest commits that aren't ready to be merged into main

Had first check in with Code with JV course on AI. Starting to learn about the different ways you can use AI effectively as a software developer, and especially as a new developer, that super charges your learning instead of hurting it.

Learned about Aider a cool terminal based assistant that has a Neovim plugin which I'm stoked about.

I practiced hard resetting the HEAD back 1 commit and then force pushing my updates to remove a commit that I didn't want in the commit history.
`git reset --hard HEAD~1`
`git push origin <branch-name> --force`

learning how to get a download working from my github repo is pretty cool, not sure yet how I'll need to change this once I get the site deployed, but works well for now.

Also learned in the process when you have an `<a>` element or a chakra react `<Link>` JSX element that you can use download to download that file or isExternal to have it open in another tab.

I had fun learning about how to make a circle in CSS or directly with Chakra-ui. Let's see if I can recall what I learned.

``` CSS
.yellow-cicle {
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
border-radius: 50%;
background-color: yellow;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
}
```
The Only thing I missed was adding in a `z-index: 1;` as I was using this to layer the circle with an image. Additionally in the css style I'd apply this class to a div, and then put that div inside another div with a relative position, for more accurate placement of the circle.

``` React.js + Chakra-ui
<Box
position="relative"
width="100%"
height={<Number>} // I know this should be a number variable that matches the circle height but not quite sure what to do.
>
<Box
  position="absolute"
  top="50%"
  left="50%"
  width="200px"
  height="200px"
  borderRadius="50%"
  backgroundColor="yellow.500"
  transform="translate(-50%, -50%)"
  zIndex={1}
  ></Box>
</Box>
```
