description: I've gotten into the habit of finishing the day befores journal on the next day. It's eroding my memory, and making the sharing of my learning a bit boilerplate.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Add to my learning journal as I am going through the day. Don't way until tomorrow.
1. Fix what's most important. we are one day away from going live, so I imagine lots of testing, and fixing of :crossed_fingers: small bugs, and hopefully we don't uncover some ungodly monstrosity of a bug that we MUST fix.
1. next item

### What are my challenges today?
following through on my journaling practice improvements.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I did not. This is the next morning and I have skipped completing my journal same day.

### What have I learned today?
I have learned that big PR's suck. That one I was talking in the day before's journal. Is coming back to haunt me. I think this is where I have to be more on my game when relying on ai assitants. I have to, and usually am super diligent with reviewing and understanding the work I have done with an ai assistant, but with this one I guess I like the vibe control me :zany:. Because a majority of the code was the same code, and I was just moving it around making it more modular, I wasn't as scrutinizing of the code, as well as it was a lot of code so my eyes got a big glazed. **All excuses**, but I learned things. Our company policy is that when you touch a piece of code, you need to leave it better than you found it. essentially if you are working on a piece of code and you see some tech debt. you should fix it. which I get, but it also creates that healthly tension between going fast.  Also, one thing that was a bit embarrasing was that I completely forgot to connect one piece of code that was refactored into a different file. Claude didn't catch it, Gemini didn't catch it in the code review, and I didn't catch it when testing the app functionality. This is a good reeason for having unit and integration testing as it would have caught this. I wasn't hitting the problem because of the seed data, but the error would have happended with putting in the first bit of live data. Thankfully I have an incredible colleague with a sharp eye that was able to spot it.

##### If I had to break it down into learnings
- Keep PRs as small as possible.
- Fix all of the tech debt you find, or at minimum surface it to the team so the team can decide.
- Take the time you need to review it, don't let pressure (self imposed or otherwise) make you rush your own review and understanding.
- keep PRs as small as possible :zany:

## Journal
How do I improve my journaling performance :laughing:

Not trying to get more "output" just trying to improve the consistency and the timing so that I end up journaling when the learnings are a bit fresher in my noggin. Why because I'd like improve me retention and ability to recall the things I learn in more detail, instead of just synthesizing them into my brain, maybe they're still there, maybe they aren't.

It's making me think of skateboarding. My main form of exercise is skateboarding, and when you are learning a new trick in skateboarding, you try, and you try and if you are lucky you eventually land it for the first time, and then you try again and you land it again! This is an exciting moment, but a common thing you'll here from other skaters that have been watching and cheering you on is "Lock it in" Do it again so you know that you've got it. That's my main goal with this journal. If I reiterate what I have learned, I'm more likely to "lock it in" and just letting those learning get stale by 12 hours before I "lock it in" means I'm at worst not going to remember it at all, and at best I'm going to pancake those learnings into a highlevel statement that doesn't truly represent what I learned but more is a statement like "I learned xyz".
