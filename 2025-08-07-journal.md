description: I've gotten into the habit of finishing the day befores journal on the next day. It's eroding my memory, and making the sharing of my learning a bit boilerplate.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Add to my learning journal as I am going through the day. Don't way until tomorrow.
1. Fix what's most important. we are one day away from going live, so I imagine lots of testing, and fixing of :crossed_fingers: small bugs, and hopefully we don't uncover some ungodly monstrosity of a bug that we MUST fix.

## Journal
How do I improve my journaling performance :laughing:

Not trying to get more "output" just trying to improve the consistency and the timing so that I end up journaling when the learnings are a bit fresher in my noggin. Why because I'd like improve me retention and ability to recall the things I learn in more detail, instead of just synthesizing them into my brain, maybe they're still there, maybe they aren't.

It's making me think of skateboarding. My main form of exercise is skateboarding, and when you are learning a new trick in skateboarding, you try, and you try and if you are lucky you eventually land it for the first time, and then you try again and you land it again! This is an exciting moment, but a common thing you'll here from other skaters that have been watching and cheering you on is "Lock it in" Do it again so you know that you've got it. That's my main goal with this journal. If I reiterate what I have learned, I'm more likely to "lock it in" and just letting those learning get stale by 12 hours before I "lock it in" means I'm at worst not going to remember it at all, and at best I'm going to pancake those learnings into a highlevel statement that doesn't truly represent what I learned but more is a statement like "I learned xyz".
