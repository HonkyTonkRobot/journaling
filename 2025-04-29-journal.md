# Journal Entry 2025-04-29

## Where to start
I haven't been here in a while, and I've decided to make this restart into journaling public-facing. With the goal of learning in public, and asking for solicited and unsolicited feedback. Being vulnerable to the opinions people will make of me, my personality, and abilities as a software developer.

### Plan of action
Maybe I should talk about goals first

### Goals
1. Practice going through the motions.
  e.g. git workflow, wire-framing, full-stack development, deployment.
2. Build a new throw-away project each week to get the reps in.
3. Have a specific new learning goal for each project.
  e.g. Implementing Authorization, streamlining md to html for static blog post.

- Daily journal four Q's and maybe have a specific topic to reflect on like. Learning how to use Neovim, or Scheme, or setting up a dotfile for wezTerm.
- Practice process improvement - daily improvements to process that I can improve my speed not with my mental capacity, but to remove friction so I can have more focus on growing my mental capacity and not admin
- Video Journal or live code (this is optional, but could be a way to expand how I "learn in public"
- share on Linkedin, ask for feedback
- Practice time boxing

**I am currently without a job as I just finished Dev Academy Aotearoa** - so additional goal until I get hired is to apply for 1 job a day

## Action
For my course work, I need to have a link to my CV on GitHub, but I feel like just giving people my CV which includes my previous employment reference letters. It's a bit weird to just have that floating around on the internet, especially when the gist of the CV can be seen on LinkedIn.

Idea, create a one page app, to collect, name, company, and email that auto-sends the CV to their email. That way I can gather data on the people taking a look. Sure I could get fake info, but at least it will create more friction, and give me a way to follow up with potentially interested parties.

This week I am going to break my 1-week limit, to the rest of this week, and next. I know, it's week one and I'm already adjusting the constraints, but I am going on vacation next week so it will basically be a wash of time, and it's already Tuesday this week so I look at my actual available time as one week.

## Four Q's
### Start of Day:

#### What are my goals today?
Restart journaling

#### What are my challenges today?
Finding the time to do it, among the course work, and applying for jobs.

### End of Day

#### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, I did find the time to get the job application done, and to start the journaling, and to make a plan.
#### What have I learned today?
I've learned about how to answer interview questions.

We talked about the STAR method, and some common NZ interview questions. My homework is to think of some answers from experience and write them out in the star method.
