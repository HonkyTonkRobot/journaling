# Journal Entry 2025-04-29

## Where to start
I haven't been here in a while, and I've decided to make this restart into journaling public facing. With the goal of learning in public, and asking for solicited and unsolicited feedback. Being vulnerable to the opinions people will make of me, my personality, and abilities as a software developer.

### Plan of action
Maybe I should talk about goals first

### Goals
1. Practice going through the motions.
  e.g. git workflow, wire-framing, full-stack development, deployment.
2. Build a new throw-away project each week to get the reps in.
3. Have a specific new learning goal for each project.
  e.g. Implementing Authorization, streamlining md to html for static blog post.

- Daily journal four Q's and maybe have a specific topic to reflect on like. Learning how to use Neovim, or Scheme, or setting up a dot file for wezTerm.
- Practice process improvement - daily improvements to process that I can improve my speed not with my mental capacity, but to remove friction so I can have more focus on growing my mental capacity and not admin
- Video Journal or live code (this is optional, but could be a way to expand how I "learn in public"
- share on Linkedin, ask for feedback
- Practice time boxing

**I am currently without a job as I just finished Dev Academy Aotearoa** - so additional goal until I get hired is to apply for 1 job a day

## Four Q's
### Start of Day:

#### What are my goals today?
Restart journaling

#### What are my challenges today?
Finding the time to do it, among the course work, and applying for jobs.

### End of Day

#### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, I did find the time to get the job application done, and to start the journaling, and to make a plan.
#### What have I learned today?
I've learn about how to answer interview questions.

We talked about the STAR method, and some common NZ interview questions. My homework is to think of some answers from experience write out in the star method and then practice answering them.
