## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get this email flow working, ahhhhh! that is all


### What are my challenges today?
not reaching out for help. I've gotta reach out for help more when I am getting stuck. I've got really talented developers on my team that have done this exact thing before, so I need to lean on them a bit more than I have. It can be hard to reach out because I've always needed to prove I can do it. which has helped me have a learners mindset, but it actually doesn't optimize my learning.By getting someone to just show you the right way. or help you break through something that is blocking you.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I am so glad I found out about neovim. Talking to a dev friend I asked what IDE they used and they said VIM. "what's that?" they said don't worry about it just use vscode maybe explore vim later. This just tickled something in my brain, I had to know what this thing was I was told not to do. Almost like someone suggesting I couldn't do it (I know that's not what they meant) made me want to find out more.

I watched a YouTube video on Vim and signed up for Vim Adventures (pretty fun game), and started exploring what vim is. I was already doing journaling with markdown, so I decided to start doing my journaling in markdown in vim to practice Vim. This turned out to be great! This was before I even started to learn to code. It gave me a pretty easy start because I already knew markdown. Then by the time I started at Dev Academy I was pretty good at the basic vim motions. And then going back to talk to those friends they were like oh wow you learned it? cool! That's when they introduced me to NeoVim which is basicallly a version of vim that has tons of opensource plugins that allows you to customize how you work in vim.

### Things I love about it.
1. I work straight in the terminal
2. I can really customize it how I want, unlike any piece of software, like really customize it, the UI, the way menus display, it's incredible.
3. I am doing this by coding in Lua, which I don't know very well but am learning through having the interest to tinker with my config, to get it just how I like. Making 2 second improvements to my workflow by making my neovim config match my workflow.

You might be thinking you can customize VScode pretty heavily, but it's really just a different experience. I'd recommend trying it, but I would suggest just throwing out your current IDE with the bath water. Play Vim adventures, then slowly start moving over to it.

### Getting to my point for today's journal.
I spent all evening improving my neovim config. I had been working with all my code in 3 800+ line files, and it was getting overwelhming so I refactored it to be more modular putting every plugin in it's own separate file. Now I feel like when I am tweaking a plugin I can have the clear brainspace and not get all jumbled by the 800 lines of code. Also means I don't need to scroll endlessly.
