## Journal
I'm going to skip my project this week. I don't like skipping as I like to stick to a plan, but it's a full on week, and I only have so much bandwidth, so making strategic choices of what I will work on is important.

I was riding my bike into work this morning, and cheekily broke a traffic rule. Another cyclist called me out on it, he did so calmly and with direct feedback. I really appreciated it. I think a younger me would have fluffed it off, but I have really grown to love feedback, especially how well he delivered it while biking of all things. It's a mistake I won't make again because of his actions, and will become a safer cyclist.
