## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get the App deployed
2. To not do any coding revisions/refactoring despite how much I want to
3. Apply for a job
4. Get some life admin completed.

### What are my challenges today?
I've got a lot of stuff on and I could just play with my app, and bask in the joy of completing it. I definitely will celebrate my win, but make sure to get on with my other tasks I need to complete today.

The other challenge. I don't really know how long this will take to deploy. Maybe I'll have it done in a hour maybe it will take me all day.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
