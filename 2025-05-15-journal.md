description: Today I need to figure out how to deploy my app so people can use it.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get the App deployed
2. To not do any coding revisions/refactoring despite how much I want to
3. Apply for a job
4. Get some life admin completed.

### What are my challenges today?
I've got a lot of stuff on and I could just play with my app, and bask in the joy of completing it. I definitely will celebrate my win, but make sure to get on with my other tasks I need to complete today.

The other challenge. I don't really know how long this will take to deploy. Maybe I'll have it done in a hour maybe it will take me all day.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
No, **but** I got the important stuff done, and there's still time left so I may come back and update this.

1. The App is deployed!
2. The only code I changed was for getting the site deployed.
3. I applied to one new job

I've done 0 life admin :/

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
Hooray! I've got a live application :celebrate:

In the process I learned how to setup a project on render.com which is pretty cool. Seems a bit like vercel and Supabase combined.

I also learned about how to setup environment key variables for my knexfile render.com connection.

I had made a mistake or rather an oversight when switching from using `sqlite3` to using `postgres` that my knex file needs to be `table.increments('id').primary()` and can no longer be `table.integer('id).primary()`. This created a problem because I already had initialized the table on render.com so even though I updated my code the problem persisted. With the help of ChatGPT I was able to sort it out.

1. First I installed PSQL CLS and then used the render generated PSQL command for accessing the database in the command line.

**Which breaksdown to this:**
``` CLI
PGPASSWORD=your-password-string psql -h your-database-hostname -U your-username -d your-database-name -p your-port-number-likely-5432
```
2. Now I can run sql commands right in the terminal.
I started by running the `PSQL` command `\d table_name`, this command is asking to display the schema for the named table. This is how I was able to confirm that my id column was indeed integer and not increments

3. Now that I was sure the problem was I ran the following SQL commands
``` SQL
CREATE SEQUENCE table_name_id_seq;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('prospects_id_seq');
```

What I found interesting about this is I couldn't just change the ID column from INTEGER to SERIAL, I could have run these commands
``` SQL
ALTER TABLE prospects DROP COLUMN id;
ALTER TABLE prospects ADD COLUMN id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;
```
But I wasn't sure how that would effect the system. I also could have deleted the postgres db on render.com and made a new one, but what I chose was to change the default value to be a nextval() function. with an argument that is a sequence object - a db object that generates a sequence of unique numberic values, which can be used for primary keys or other unique indentifiers.

This achieves the same result of having a SERIAL id COLUMN from the start, and was a useful way to change it.

This would also be really useful if the db was already really huge. dropping a column and adding a new column could be risky where this method allows for getting the functionality needed while protecting the data, if there was already existing data.
