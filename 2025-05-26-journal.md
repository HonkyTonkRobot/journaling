## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [-] Decided on and plan new project
- [-] pair with Mix
- [-] Share last weeks project on Linkedin
- [-] reflect on last project for Phx.

### What are my challenges today?
I think my challenges are managing the fact that I will have a lot of stop starts due to meetings.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
- [x] Share last weeks project on LinkedIn

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
Ok, This weeks project is going to be about trying by hand a Spring Boot and Java without the assistance of a code along.

#### Project Requirements
1. React, TypeScript client-side
2. Springboot, java Server-side
3. PostgreSQL database
4. Include some unit testing (fuzzier at the moment.)
5. Use Docker and Docker-compose
6. Frontend and backend in monorepo

#### Folder Structure (ChatGPT recommended)
my-crud-app/
├── frontend/         # React + TypeScript app
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ...
├── backend/          # Java Spring Boot app
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ...
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md

#### Project
**Simple Notes APP**
- Able to add, edit, delete notes
- displays all notes on home page by note title sorted by alpha-numeric order
- Notes have body, and convert first line into title, and auto add date to front of title.

stretch:
- Pagination
- Add categories labels
- Able to parse markdown


_**Back to Journalling**_
Wow, this was an interesting journey. I'm doing another springboot/java CRUD app, and decided to make a boiler-plate based off my React/node.js full-stack boiler plate, and wrap it all up with docker-compose. Another element to all this is my AI coding essentials course I'm doing with Joshua Vial. So I decided to test out some of the tools I've been learning about and use it to help me redo my boilerplate as this is all code I am pretty familiar with how it should look.

I used VSCode/Cline which took me out of neovim, but that's ok. It was more about trying out an easy to access ai coding assistant than getting my workspace setup.

Things I learned, It's pretty good at taking high level prompts and turning them into explicit set of steps that it then walks through one at a time. I was able to see it's proposed changes give it feedback, and then it would adjust it's action. _FYI: this is with the free gemini api_ I was able to walk it all the way through getting my folder structure and getting the basics for both the frontend and backend and docker files setup.

Once I started to test the environment, I started to see that it had missed a few details. Though I was able to use my error messages generated from running `docker-compose up --build` and see where the problems were in the app, which mostly came down to the pom.xml and docker-compose.yml. And just like that I had the boiler plate setup.

I then realised I didn't have Springboot setup the way I needed it to so I went to sprinboot to initilize a project, and get a better backend structure than what was generated by the AI.  I probably should have started here, but it was good to see what AI could and couldn't do.
