## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get a deeper understanding for OOP


### What are my challenges today?
making sure I find the time to learn this, using the existing codebase and not going to quickly due to time pressures.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal2
I'm finding it interesting teaching myself using AI. OOP is not something I'm super familiar with so what I did was get `Claude` to teach me OOP using the current projects code base, so how I was learning was tailored specifically to the project I was currently working on. I gave it a prompt along the lines of:

_teach me OOP using code from this code base, start with basic concepts and work up to high level implementation in this project. No more than 10 exercises, and each exercise should include practice problems, and the whole exercise including practice problems should take no longer than 30 minutes each._

So far it has done a great job, and it's like having a teacher on tap, When I get stuck, I show the work I've done so fat and it's able to give tips or hints on what I should do next.
