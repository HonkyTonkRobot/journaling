description: Today feels like a day for learning. Will spend a goo bit of energy learning OOP as it is currently holding back my ability to make progress on this project. that was built as a domain driven OOP application.
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get a deeper understanding for OOP


### What are my challenges today?
making sure I find the time to learn this, using the existing codebase and not going to quickly due to time pressures.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, I think so, did some OOP practice, did a refactor a couple of service classes. We have a monorepo with two different applications, that have a shared folder. I extracted the shared functions into a shared service. so it gave me an opportunity to write a new class, though I had a really solid model that I could basically copy, so it made it easy, but easy is good while learning.


### What have I learned today?
I learned about how interfaces work with classes and how you can have a method as a part of that interface. I'm used to writing something like:
```ts
interface UserData {
  status: () => void
}

// But with classes you can have something like
interface UserData {
  status(): string
}
```
And the expectation is inside the class there will be a method called `status()`

I also did some exploring of `Figma first draft` and `Figma Make` I was really keen to get a UI library like Chakra-ui to work with first draft

I also did some exploring of `Figma first draft` and `Figma Make` I was really keen to get a UI library like Chakra-ui to work with first draft. ie. When I prompt the LLM to make me a home page for a todo list app, that it could use the design library that I have custom edited, but unfortunately it's only able to use some defaults. Also, I learned that things like Chakra-ui and Material UI are harder for LLM's to implement because they can't see the code for the elements where something like ShadCN powered by tailwind, is much easier for an LLM to work with and I guess is why all of the Vibe coding tools use it.

## Journal
I'm finding it interesting teaching myself using AI. OOP is not something I'm super familiar with so what I did was get `Claude` to teach me OOP using the current projects code base, so how I was learning was tailored specifically to the project I was currently working on. I gave it a prompt along the lines of:

_teach me OOP using code from this code base, start with basic concepts and work up to high level implementation in this project. No more than 10 exercises, and each exercise should include practice problems, and the whole exercise including practice problems should take no longer than 30 minutes each._

So far it has done a great job, and it's like having a teacher on tap, When I get stuck, I show the work I've done so fat and it's able to give tips or hints on what I should do next.

### Vibe coding tools
I've been trying to imaging the ideal workflow. What I feel like would be the ideal workflow for someone like me that is a product designer (the Industrial design type) that starting in Figma with wireframes, using an MCP server to connect it to Claude code and then going from there would be ideal. I am finding the vibe coding tools like `Figma Make`, `v0.dev` (favorite at the moment) to be lacking. They try so hard to make a working website where, is All I want is the design layouts, and a way to use `Claude Code` or `GEMINI Code` in my terminal to build out the application. I think Figma is going to win out on this front, but the tool still has a long way to go.
