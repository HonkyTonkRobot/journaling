description: This week is all about coding. I've already done about two days work on the project. So I am limiting the coding to 3 days, to keep with my urgency plan.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get in some solid coding. I will get the route setup for adding new data to the database. I can't remember if I did a db diagram, so will do that too if I haven't already.

### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've got a lot of distractions like the pressure to apply for jobs, but I know getting my practice in is just as important for the job hunt.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I've been working on building out the form for my app. I've been trouble shooting why my regex is not working on the validation.

**Things I tried**
1. Add a form element around the FormControl from Chakra and add a submit button
  - This resulted in getting the default html output for improper email format, and nothing for the linkedIn format.

What I realized was wrong is I had a double !! for my isInvalid field instead of !

This fixed it, and finally got the error messages rendering straight away for email and linkedin, but the problem I realised I had is I wanted to show it after an attempt.

So I tried adding an onBlur and a handleEmailBlur as I'd used that before in a previous project. I tried moving the JSX for the FormErrorMessage up to the handleEmailBlur but that didn't work because, well you can't have JSX outside the return :(

So I turned to AI with my question, and ChatGPT suggested adding an onBlur the set a new useState for has a blur occurred, and then adding the state to the ternary alongside the regex test.

This solved the problem. I didn't realize I needed state for this, but I am learning that everything with a, well, changing state needs useState.
