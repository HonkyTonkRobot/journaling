description: This week is all about coding. I've already done about two days work on the project. So I am limiting the coding to 3 days, to keep with my urgency plan.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get in some solid coding. I will get the route setup for adding new data to the database. I can't remember if I did a db diagram, so will do that too if I haven't already.

### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've got a lot of distractions like the pressure to apply for jobs, but I know getting my practice in is just as important for the job hunt.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?
