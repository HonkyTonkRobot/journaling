## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To pick up the most important task today

### What are my challenges today?
Coming into a day with no priority I am wary. It could mean I get to choose what is imporatant, or it could mean I get ripped away to a new project, which is fine, but usually makes the day less enjoyable.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I have started to learn basic sentence structure for te reo Māori, and enjoying trying to create everyday sentences in te reo. Fortunately my parter knows a good amount of te reo so kōrero :wink: with her is possible.
