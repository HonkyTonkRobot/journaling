## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To pick up the most important task today

### What are my challenges today?
Coming into a day with no priority I am wary. It could mean I get to choose what is imporatant, or it could mean I get ripped away to a new project, which is fine, but usually makes the day less enjoyable.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I have, I was able to do some new work on a project I have been wanting to work on, so excited to be able to pick up a few tickets on it.

### What have I learned today?
Existing codebases are hard to get up to speed on. This is a big extensive code base and is a monorepo with several different applications. It's also in a different tech stack with the biggest difference being the backend is python. It's pretty straightforward to figure out by comparing to JS concepts, but still unconfortable, which is how growth goes.

## Journal
I have started to learn basic sentence structure for te reo Māori, and enjoying trying to create everyday sentences in te reo. Fortunately my parter knows a good amount of te reo so kōrero :wink: with her is possible.
