## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Keep pushing through this ticket. It's a tough ticket that requires me to coordinate with other people. That makes it hard to get in the flow, especially when those people are busy on their own things, and communication is async. I will persevere :strong::rofl:

### What are my challenges today?
Team communication, thinking about sick family, recovering from sickness, and tiredness. I could go on. It's funny I normally am unsure of what to put here and I've gotta really dig deep to decuided what are my real challenges for the day which is useful. Today on the other hand I feel like I could list a million things.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I've been on vacation for the last week, the week before I was working full time, and managing having family visiting, and this week my family unit is sick :sad: This is all leading me to feel a bit tired. Also, getting back into routines is hard especially when I am run down. I know the routines will help me get back to normal and be less run down, so hopefully tomorrow, I'll be back to my normal chirpy self.
