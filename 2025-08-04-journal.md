description: It's the last full week before launch, this week is just about smashing stuff out, and hopefullyu not creating to much tech debt from just pumping it out.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Finish off my PR that I didn't quite get deployed because I forgot to `run build` :eyes:
Then the task will be finding the next bug, or hopefully magically their will be no other bugs, but I know that won't happen.

### What are my challenges today?
I realize I missed my mission from Thursday, I was supposed to find all of the bugs document them, and then we strategically complete them based on the time remaining. Instead I found and fixed them one at a time. So today is all about finishing what I was tasked with.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
