## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
It's the weekend so I am just going to play around with the figma make project I was working on a few weeks ago. I haven't picked it up in awhile and really keen to find a workflow that works with figma make. Even though we use next.js/vercel sometimes I really feel like figma is going to win this space because of their design chops. I just need them to get better faster :laughing:. Though they just made a partnership with SupaBase, and because Supabase has RLS you could technically build a secure app with just frontend, and Supabase. I don't think I'd build a production app like this but I just want to play around and see if it really is possible.

### What are my challenges today?
I have very little time, unless I stay up late tonight so we shall see.

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
So a few days/weeks? ago I figured out the neovim command `:saveas <new-file-name>` or `:sav` which really spead up making a new journal from my template. I was doing `:w` write `:Ex` exit back to the directory and then opening the new file, which was annoying and definitely costing me 2 seconds multiple times a day. Well I made it even better, maybe it's still in trial but feels faster. new process `cp TE<tab-completion> <new-file-name>` using the copy command and tab completing the only file that has "TE" in it. The part I am not sure is faster is opening the actual file. `fd` which opens my terminal fuzzy finder which allows me to add multiple strings and it narrows to the files that contain those strings think of it like a search function I just type in <mm><dd><enter> and I'm in the new file. where it may be faster to `nvim .` open the current directory in NeoVim Jump to the last file, go up to files `<jj>` in the directory which is always the newest journal entry and press `<Enter>` Ok, I just tried both 30 times I think the `nvim .` is faster :rofl:.
