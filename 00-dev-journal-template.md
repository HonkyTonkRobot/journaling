## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals are to finish the refactor on the frontend.

### What are my challenges today?
Not getting stuck. yesterday was quite the trudge. It felt like I wasn't able to get into a flow state, and smash out work. It was constant stop start. normally I can carve out 3-4 hour blocks to really getting things done, but had a lot of interruptions (self imposed) and context switching, that I want to try and not repeat today.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
