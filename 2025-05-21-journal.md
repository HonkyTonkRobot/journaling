## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [ ] Finish my code a long getting familiar with Springboard and java
- [ ] Write 5 more STAR Questions
- [ ] Techweek event


### What are my challenges today?
I'm not sure. I feel pretty solid in my plan for the day. A lot of work, but not too much. Maybe complacence and missing my goals.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
-[x] Finish my code along :raised_hands:

### What have I learned today?
I have reinforced a lot of my react learnings using useState, useEffect, useNavigation, useParams.
  - making handler functions
  - update form state, submitting forms to a db

I learned about @PostMapping and @DeleteMapping @PutMapping in java/springboot

## Journal
Today was a good day, feeling really confident with what I have been learning. I still don't know java super well, but it's all starting to make since, as it's a really similar type of language to JavaScript atleast when doing CRUD operations in a fullstack app.
