title: Really starting to get the hang of the java sentax and jargon

description: Made great progress on my code along fullstack springboot/java project. starting to get the hang of how it's similar and how it's different to JavaScript (React, TypeScript, Node).

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [ ] Finish my code a long getting familiar with Springboard and java
- [ ] Write 5 more STAR Questions
- [ ] Techweek event


### What are my challenges today?
I'm not sure. I feel pretty solid in my plan for the day. A lot of work, but not too much. Maybe complacence and missing my goals.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
- [x] Finish my code along :raised_hands:
- [x] Techweek event at Springload

### What have I learned today?
I have reinforced a lot of my react learnings using useState, useEffect, useNavigation, useParams.
  - making handler functions
  - update form state, submitting forms to a db

I learned about @PostMapping and @DeleteMapping @PutMapping in java/springboot

**REST API = REpresentational State Transfer API (Application Programming Interface)**
I've also gotten more clarity of What REST API is, and after getting a definition, i realize I know very well what it is. It's essentially a type of API that uses `Get, Post, Patch, put, delete` requests and allows you to access resources via URL and get back JSON or XML

I got a reminder about what CORS is.
It's a browser security feature that controls whether your frontend can call your backend if they're on different domains/ports

I learned more the different elements and naming conventions in Java
1. Class - is like a component in react.js it contains all of the code for a particular piece of the code base.
  - additionally learned about calling a classes constructor to create a new object that is stored in the variable that has been declared
  `Type variableName = new Type();`
2. Interface - is how you define the shape of a method
``` java
public interface Animal {
  void makeSound()
}
```
Implementation
``` java
public class Dog implements Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
  System.out.println("Woof!");
  }
}
```
3. Methods - is both built in functions, and is how you define your own functions
4. package - is a like a directory
5. import - how you import an external classes, interfaces. It's also how you import built in types or types from other libraries.
6. Fields - are how you manage state or pass state from one class to another

6. modifiers like:
  - public - means that it can be accessed in other classes when it's classes constructor is called
  - private - mean it can't be accessed directly, but if for say a private variable is encapsulated in a public method with parameters, that method can be called to update the private variable.
  - static - It's a way to call a method without having to construct a new object from the class.
``` java
public class Utils {
  public static int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
```
Another Class called Test
```
import com.example.utils

  public class Test {
    int result = Utils.add(7,3);
  }
}
```
  - final - basically means what ever it is it can't be overwritten. similar to const for variables in JS/TS. Where it differs is it can also be used to prevent methods from being overridden, and classes from being extended.
7. Exceptions - error handling like `throw`, `try` / `catch`, `throws`, and `finally`

## Journal
Today was a good day, feeling really confident with what I have been learning. I still don't know java super well, but it's all starting to make since, as it's a really similar type of language to TypeScript/Node atleast when doing CRUD operations in a fullstack app.
