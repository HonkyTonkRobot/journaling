## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
push on with tickets and not run tests as pytest is the culprit for crashing my computer. not sure if I am just being punished for being a linux user or If I did something while playing around with my keyboard mapping. :man_shrugging:


### What are my challenges today?
Trying not to let the anger, sadness, and frustration of yesterday seep over into a new day.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I think yesterday was the most difficult day in my short career as a programmer. An un-parralled level of frustration, that spilled over into my personal life because I took that frustration home with me, not a fan of that.

Today is a new day, and a good reminder that not everyday (ia rā) is going to be successful and that the important thing is to treat each day like as a separate opportunity to succeed.
