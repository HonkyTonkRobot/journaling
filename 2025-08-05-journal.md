description: maybe I should say I like bug hunting and then fixing them. there's something rewarding about the process. Especially when they are small enough that they can be tackled in a day.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals, finish off my PR review (self review) then request team review, get on to the next bug.


### What are my challenges today?
I'm in an efficiency mood, I try to spend 15 minutes every day trying to make a "2 second improvement" something I learned from lean manufacturing. idea is to try and make one small efficiency improvement everyday, and over time it will add up to huge productivity gains.

`We often over estimate what we can achieve in a short time, and underestimate what we can achieve in a long time.`

I love this quote because it helps remind me to make these small improvements and not spend a bunch of time once a month trying to make hugh improvements. Instead spend 15 minutes make one new keyboard shortcut, add one new alias to your shell config. etc.   And I have found the key is to fix what bugs you. What thing do you do all of the time that you are putting up with that would be great if it was faster.

Anyways why this is todays challenge is because I could easily do more than 15 minutes today, but I need to constrain that desire, and keep focused on the work at hand. daily consistency, not binge optimization. Otherwise I'd spend all of my time figuring out what color scheme I want my oh-my-zsh to be :laughing:
