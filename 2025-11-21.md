## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
I've planned my next ticket based on feedback from my mentoring co-worker. Got that planned before the end of my day yesterday so stoked to get straight into it today.
my other goals are to keep learning about cron jobs. I started before my family came to visit, but was a bit time poor while they were here. My other goals outside of work goals are to find some more learning resources for my te Reo Māori learning journey.


### What are my challenges today?
Challenges today, I am doing some team pairing for the first time in a month. I'm really excited, because I love pairing. I feel like I learn heaps when I do this, and just working in a remote company, It's actually really nice to have face time with my co-workers, as I am low level extroverted.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

## Journal

## Te Reo Māori & Exercise.
I was supposed to be working on it intensely over the last 90 days on my Māori learning journey and getting into more fitness/exercise. I have neglected that, achieving very little in those departments outside of what I was already doing.

Yesterday I took a strong step in both of those. I did a 5 minute ab workout I found on youtube, and surprised how much I liked doing a follow along for that. It meant I could focus on the exercise and my brain was able to relax instead of thinking of the next thing to do. I also commited to a monday lunch workout with a friend. An accountability partner for at least one workout per week doing a short run and some body weight exercises.

As for Te Reo Māori, yesterday was an incredible learning day as every day i spend out with my kid, I do a lot of practicing by talking to her about what I see in the world around us. Mostly vocab, but yesterday felt like a leap in the amount of new words I had learned and a much more comprehesive ability to talk about the world around us without going to my dictionary. So I remember a link my friend Kenji shared with me from the spinoff that had some great Te Reo Māori resources. I used that to add some new learning apps, to revive some apps I have used before, and fell out of practice, and to find some podcasts. I mostly listen to two types of podcasts.

1. Startup podcasts ie. `The Startup Podcast`, `Y combinator podcast`, `Lenny's Podcast`, `Truthworks`, `Wild hearts` and `AI & I`
2. shortform storytelling about people and the world. ie. `This American Life`, `99% invisible`, `Freak-a-nomics`, `Planet Money`, and `Darknet Diaries`

Though I have been finding myself not really wanting to listen to any of these recently, and still finding myself reaching for podcasts, but nothing grabbing me enough to give my time to listening. Then I realised I'd love to listen to some Te Reo Māori podcasts, mostly focused around learning.

so goal is to try out a few and find atleast one I like. Then I'll add another next week. I like having a few of each category of podcast I listen to because I listen selectively to the ones that catch my interest, and skip the rest. So if I only have one in that genre there may not be one I want to listen to when I'm in the mood for a podcast.

I say I've lacked interest in podcasts recently, but I have done something a few times recently that I've never been able to do before. Listen to podcasts to fall to sleep. I have a notoriously bad time trying to fall asleep and typically use `Brooklyn 99` A show I have seen 100 times through to fall asleep. I would love to switch to listening to podcasts as it's even less stimulating than tv, the problem is I need something that does catch my attention. So maybe I need to find the `Brooklyn 99` podcast where it's just the audio and no video :laughing:
