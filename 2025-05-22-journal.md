description: Last day of prep before my first interview. And I am feeling good about the prepperation I have done.
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [ ] Mock interview with trusted advisor
- [ ] Study interview prep from Dev Academy course
- [ ] deploy this weeks fullstack app based on the companies tech stack.
- [ ] Dev Academy AI Coding Essentials course work

### What are my challenges today?
Getting it all done. I've got a lot of things that I want to get done, like adding issues/tickets for both last weeks project and this weeks project as improvements I'd like to make. JV (my teacher for "AI Coding Essentials") gave me the idea to come up with ideas for improvements, and writing documentation using the course, so maybe I'll do that.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I didn't deploy the app, but I did discover how to do it. And decided to just leave it as a code, base and instead write instructions for launching it locally.
- [x] Dev Academy AI Coding Essentials course work
- [x] Mock interview with trusted advisor
- [x] Study interview prep from Dev Academy course

### What have I learned today?
I practiced interview prep. I mostly learned what some good questions to ask are, I learned what my good stories are for common interview questions. I learned that in an interview being excited about code, passion, and having grit when solving a problem are important.


## Journal
**Questions for course Q&A**
1. What's the reason advantages/disadvantages of enabling docker-desktop to run on computer sign-in?
2. I'm seeing the fraction cents/pennies adding up, but I haven't put in any CC details, is this just telling me what it would cost if I wasn't on the free version?

### Interview prep notes
- Q? Tell me about your current side project? (Don always asks)
- If live coding try and get them to do it on the PC
- If given a techincal test question, make sure you have all the info you need. Ask clarifying questions.

e.g. write a function that converts roman numerals to numbers.
Q's - What range of numbers 1-10, 1-100, 1-infinity?
Q's - How much time do I have?


Types of tests:
1. timed
2. take-home 1-2 days MAX

- When writing code, use good naming/linting practices. If there is any public available code from the company look at it and follow their practices.

- Get the code working, then refactor, then start writing unit tests
- study the language of the company

- If you have extra time, do it another way, and share that later. **shows initiative**

Things to make sure I know how to explain:
- Understanding the difference in var, let, const
- Object context. how the this keyword works
- difference between call, apply, and bind
- prototype inheritance, how does the prototype chain work

**keep your functions 10 lines max in size**

### What am I looking for in an interview:
1. Passion
2. Excited about some code you have written.
3. Show grit

### What do you take to the interview
- pad and pen
- Take questions

2. What distinguishes a top performer in this role from a good one?

4. What's your current approach to testing across the stack (unit, integration, E2E)?
5. How do you manage staging and production environments, and what’s your general deployment workflow?
6. Are you practicing continuous deployment? If so, how do you ensure stability and safety with that approach?
7. What are your policies around customer data — for example, do you ever sell it — and how do those policies reflect Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori data sovereignty?
