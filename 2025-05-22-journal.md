## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [ ] Mock interview with trusted advisor
- [ ] Study interview prep from Dev Academy course
- [ ] deploy this weeks fullstack app based on the companies tech stack.
- [ ] Dev Academy AI Coding Essentials course work

### What are my challenges today?
Getting it all done. I've got a lot of things that I want to get done, like adding issues/tickets for both last weeks project and this weeks project as improvements I'd like to make. JV (my teacher for "AI Coding Essentials") gave me the idea to come up with ideas for improvements, and writing documentation using the course, so maybe I'll do that.
