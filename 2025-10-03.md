## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goal finish the current ticket I'm working on, it's a big ticket, but the process of solving it has been pretty fun.


### What are my challenges today?
keeping the momentum up, but pushing through any setbacks by learning.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
:( forgot to do this one.


### What have I learned today?
Claude code has a continue flag :wow: this is so useful, for many reasons I kill my terminal, my computer dies because I didn't realize my battery was low, I accidentally logout which kills all of my open programs. being able to come back and hit continue in the repo that I am in and it brings back the chat I was last having. :exploding_head: the cli command is `cluade --continue`

## Journal
I learned about tanstacks-react virtualization yesterday. I have a search query that has 3700+ unique values, which is obviously insane but important, so I finding a way to make that managable and not killing the browser :rofl: tanstacks-react virtualization, lazy loading, useMemo all in combination, to get a performat search box, we'll see if it works :fingers_crossed:
