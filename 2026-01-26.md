## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- Goals today to get setup on Gastown
- knock out the ticket I've been working on, which is more about site content than coding, but still excited for it.

### What are my challenges today?
Not sure. Feeling hyped today. I guess one thing that happens when I am hyped if the progress is slow I get frustrated/anxious as I am not achieving what I want. I will remind myself that it goes like that sometimes, and that is more about putting in the consistent effort, and that some days will be lower output than others.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
Over the weekend I did some more furniture making. Wow am I rusty. Many mistakes that were avoidable. Though in the end the final product looks good, and will be functional.

This past weekend was all about house work. Did two solid days of maintenance around the whare (house). That feels good planning to do a lot of that over then month.

From a learning point of view, I did some more learning (ako) about Evals, and more interestingly how to use qdrants and ingest large amounts of data into RAG (retrieval Augmented Generation) I couldn't tell you how RAG works but the basic idea I understand is it stores the info in a matrice that can then more efficiently be retrieved when being used by an LLM. This is what I was using to store a large volume of documents that were used in the eval test data.

I also have been looking into this new framework called gas town which is basically a way to orchestrate heaps of agents, but giving them small tasks instead of huge chunky tickets. It all works on top of a new issue management system called `beads` which is like a kanban board that lives in git. This allows different people using different agents to utilize the different tickets that have been made.
