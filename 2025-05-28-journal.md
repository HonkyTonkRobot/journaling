## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To get Claude desktop or another tool like notion with MCP integration working, and to get MCP working with the Chatbot project I was working on yesterday.

### What are my challenges today?
I think the challenges will be learning the course work, as it's a loose guide and my very new to coding brain is struggling connecting the dots.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
