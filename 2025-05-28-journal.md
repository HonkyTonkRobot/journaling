description: Learning about MCP's, and LangChain, and how I can build AI workflows, is proving to be quite the challenging coding project.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To get Claude desktop or another tool like notion with MCP integration working, and to get MCP working with the Chatbot project I was working on yesterday.

### What are my challenges today?
I think the challenges will be learning the course work, as it's a loose guide and my very new to coding brain is struggling connecting the dots.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutely! I was able to get Claude desktop up and running on my linux machine thanks [github.com/mixmix](https://gist.github.com/mixmix/5cd716fe9efb103b1616175987161814) I then took it a little further and wrote a launch script, and a `.desktop` file with icon.png from [Antropic Media Assets](https://www.anthropic.com/news) so that I could launch it like a normal desktop app without the need of running commands in the terminal. Then I had a look at the **AI coding essentials** chat bot repo to start learning about how to build Chat bots with python and LangChain.

### What have I learned today?
I've learned about system variables like `$PATH`, `$HOME` and `$USER`. I've learned about writing scripts or `.sh` files to execute a whole host of terminal commands by executing a single file. I also learned about `.desktop` files and how those are used to connect to my ubuntu GNOME GUI.

It's not quite the things I expected to learn but they have been interesting and helping me understand how my computer works a little bit more.

I also learned how to connect MCP's to Claude Desktop through the config file. I tried out the "FileSystem MCP Server" and the "Brave Search MCP server"

I used the FileSystem to go into one of my local repo's evaluate my project, and give me advice on where I could improve the project.

I also learned how to check and kill MCP servers once I was done with them.

right now I'm just running them with NPX, but plan to move them to Docker containers to create a bit more security for my system.
