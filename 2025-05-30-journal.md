description: This week hasn't gone to plan, but I am learning stuff and reflecting on that learning and not being to stressed that those learning weren't packaged up in a nice package to present to people.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Continue working through my week 3 challenges.
2. Pair program with another student from class.


### What are my challenges today?
I think focus is a concern today. I've got a lot swirling in my noggin like I do most days, but having this text file to write it "out loud" helps me stay conscious of that challenge.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
**Checkout Roo Code** as an alternative to Cline

I Just did a great pairing session with one of the more advanced students in my course, and He followed along as he implemented LangFuse into one of his projects. After getting it working, I then implemented it in my own project.

I learned about how Langfuse gives you a graphical interface to get tracability on LLM calls, and shows you the cost, and other features that I haven't really dove into. Probably the most important thing I learned as a new Python user is how to run the virtual environment when I am working on a Python project.

**Starts the virtual environment**
``` zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Kills the virtual environment**
``` zsh
deactivate
```

I also learned about using the Python built in class `os` for accessing `.env` files

I learned how to setup my aider config so it can find my api keys.
