description: This week hasn't gone to plan, but I am learning stuff and reflecting on that learning and not being to stressed that those learning weren't packaged up in a nice package to present to people.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Continue working through my week 3 challenges.
2. Pair program with another student from class.


### What are my challenges today?
I think focus is a concern today. I've got a lot swirling in my noggin like I do most days, but having this text file to write it "out loud" helps me stay conscious of that challenge.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?
