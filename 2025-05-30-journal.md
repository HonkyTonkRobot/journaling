description: This week hasn't gone to plan, but I am learning stuff and reflecting on that learning and not being to stressed that those learning weren't packaged up in a nice package to present to people.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Continue working through my week 3 challenges.
2. Pair program with another student from class.


### What are my challenges today?
I think focus is a concern today. I've got a lot swirling in my noggin like I do most days, but having this text file to write it "out loud" helps me stay conscious of that challenge.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I think so. I Was able to do one of the two challenges I had left for week 3, and I did pair program which was great, and made a new friend!

### What have I learned today?
I've learned a lot about development with Python, around setting up a project, virtual environments, and using package managers like uv. I also learned a little bit more about my computer and how environment variables work, and how I can set them up to be sourced from shell config file, during a session, and for a single command.

I'm really pleased with the day despite not feeling like I have much to show for it.

## Journal
**Checkout Roo Code** as an alternative to Cline

I Just did a great pairing session with one of the more advanced students in my course, and He followed along as he implemented LangFuse into one of his projects. After getting it working, I then implemented it in my own project.

I learned about how Langfuse gives you a graphical interface to get tracability on LLM calls, and shows you the cost, and other features that I haven't really dove into. Probably the most important thing I learned as a new Python user is how to run the virtual environment when I am working on a Python project.

**Starts the virtual environment**
``` zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Kills the virtual environment**
``` zsh
deactivate
```

I also learned about using the Python built in class `os` for accessing `.env` files

I learned how to setup my aider config so it can find my api keys.

I also learned a little bit more about using my Linux computer.

I learned that if you type `ALL_CAPS=string` it will add that environment variable for that one command
If you type `export ALL_CAPS=string` it will add that environment variable for that whole session
and finally if you add `export ALL_CAPS=string` to your shell file like .zshrc it will add the environment variable for every session.

Learning some more about using **UV** _An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust._
Here's a few commands:
``` zsh
uv init   # intializes the Python project
uv sync   # updates the project's environment, will add a .venv if none exists
uv run filename.py  # This is how you spin up the virtual environment (meaning no need for source .venv/bin/activate)

uv add <package-name>   # adds dependencies
uv remove <package-name>    # removes dependencies
uv lock --upgrade-packages <package-name> # attepts to update package version in lockfile

```

:mind_blown: Wow I think my head is is going to explode

Today has been fun learning about Python, but I don't feel like I achieved very much. I guess it's a cumulative thing. I learn a little everyday and over time it will be easier and easier.
