## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Not sure, what the priority will be, could be jumping back on the project that we sent live on Friday, this is most likely
Might be some last minute changes for a project we sent live a few months ago, they are moving from their beta users to public access tomorrow.

Or something else, I'm keen to maximize for learning this week if their isn't much of a pressing project, What that will likely look like is me building a next.js/supabase template repo for having auth/login reset/etc done. All the stuff that is basically the same on every project, that way if I do go the figma just get the front end screens I Can just plug it in, write the db schema, server actions, and connect it to the front-end pages.


### What are my challenges today?
Finding focus, as I'm not coming into the day with focus. The other thing is time-boxing. When doing any kind of learning it's easy to get stuck and not make progress, but I need to follow the if I am stuck for 15 minutes ask for help, or move on, and come back later.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I've make good progress on getting into my fitness routine, I haven't really stepped up my game on my te reo learning, but I have still been learning, with my morning coffee and a Te reo MƒÅori/English dictionary :laughing:

### 2 second improvement
Last week I finally made the transition to Regolith now that Regolith Swayland is a thing. I was hesistant to switch off wayland to regolith i3/x11 because well things are moving away from x11 to Wayland, but now thanks to Sway I can have the best of both worlds. It was time to rip off the band-aid and just get into it, and now I am slowly realising which keymaps, I don't have as I use stuff. The one for today is the keymap to the display settings. I work out of co-working spaces occassionaly, and when you sit at a new desk I've always gotta setup the monitors the way like, and I've got no keymap for the display settings well atleast I don't like the default so I am making a new one.
