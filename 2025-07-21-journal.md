## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Keep cracking away a setting up `Supabase` RLS on a project. This is my 3 time setting up, everytime just learning that little bit more. It feels really good. I feel like this is the part of software dev. that I am getting the most confident in. I had a little bit of experience with SQL so it's coming more naturally, but more around the learning of deploying a db through `Supabase`


### What are my challenges today?
I think staying focus on speed, and not over optimizing from the start. As a person who is interested in startups and moving quickly is gaining a deeper understanding of technical debt, and talking to our senior developers about what trade offs to make to move quickly get it in front of customers and once the feature is validated then refactoring.


## End of Day
