description: Yesterday took the plunge into looking at neovim plugins for looking at git diff, and went deep down the rabbit hole.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
It's the weekend so the goals are to pick one thing and push forward on it.

Options:
1. neovim git plugins `diffview.nvim`, `gitsigns.nvim`, `neogit.nvim`, and off topic but maybe a bit meta to the journaling process. `obsidian.nvim`
2. exploring figma AI tools further
3. thinking about a submission for NZ Tech Rally

I think I'll chose 3. as the other things I am already doing some of during the week, and also because the idea of speaking scares me a little bit, so I think that's a good sign that I should charge at it, get uncofortable, and hopefully grow from the process.

### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused on one thing, because I'd really like to do all 3.
