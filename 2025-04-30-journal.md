description: From my studies of Lean manufacturing and one the role models that I often looked to for Advice was Paul Akers who created 2 second lean which I think is a bit like the stripped down version of lean. He was such an incredible acknowledger of where he learned things and genuinly showed appreciate for the sharing and learning from his peers.

This is something I'd like to practice doing.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today are to get my GitHub Wiki, Project board setup, and some tickets issued.
### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've really loaded myself up, and with any new process there's a lot of just getting the flow setup. This weeks will be hard but next weeks can be built off of this weeks. Reminding myself that's ok.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I Haven't quite reached my goals, I did get some work done on the GitHub Wiki, and learned some things, but My time box dictates it's time to move on. Next up is setting up the issues.

### What have I learned today?
I've learned about semmantic Commit messages on [Joshbuchea/ semantic-commit-messages.md](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) that's to my colleagues from Dev Academies final project [Take It Away Ernie](https://github.com/tohora-2025/take-it-away-ernie/wiki/Gitflow)

Keen to implement this practice in my git commits, I'll try to recall the ones i remember for practice.
1. feat
2. fix
3. core?
4. files?

##### Ok, that wasn't great but here's the full list
1. feat:(new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
2. fix:(bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
3. docs:(changes to the documentation)
4. style:(formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
5. refactor:(refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable)
6. test:(adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
7. chore:(updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

Another thing I learned about was GitHub wiki templates for starting a new project. Not really sure how it works yet but just reading up and playing around with this. Time boxing getting this setup to 45 minutes, as I could easily play with this for hours if I don't

I also, learned about cloning the GitHub wiki repo for a repo to your local machine. The important thing to understand is these are separate repos. On the Wiki Home page you can then clone the page down, but you can also just add .wiki.get to project repo URL like this.
