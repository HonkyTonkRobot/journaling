## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today are to get my GitHub Wiki, Project board setup, and some tickets issued.
### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've really loaded myself up, and with any new process there's a lot of just getting the flow setup. This weeks will be hard but next weeks can be built off of this weeks. Reminding myself that's ok.

## End of Day
