## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today are to get my GitHub Wiki, Project board setup, and some tickets issued.
### What are my challenges today?
Staying focused. I've really loaded myself up, and with any new process there's a lot of just getting the flow setup. This weeks will be hard but next weeks can be built off of this weeks. Reminding myself that's ok.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?

### What have I learned today?
I've learned about semmantic Commit messages on [Joshbuchea/ semantic-commit-messages.md](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) that's to my colleagues from Dev Academies final project [Take It Away Ernie](https://github.com/tohora-2025/take-it-away-ernie/wiki/Gitflow)

Keen to implement this practice in my git commits, I'll try to recall the ones i remember for practice.
1. feat
2. fix
3. core?
4. files?

##### Ok, that wasn't great but here's the full list
1. feat:(new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
2. fix:(bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
3. docs:(changes to the documentation)
4. style:(formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
5. refactor:(refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable)
6. test:(adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
7. chore:(updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

Another thing I learned about was GitHub wiki templates for starting a new project. Not really sure how it works yet but just reading up and playing around with this. Time boxing getting this setup to 45 minutes, as I could easily play with this for hours if I don't
