description: Feeling good today, completed an important ticket day, and that really helped get me back into the groove.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get the next ticket up completed. this one is bit complex and I blame using mock data instead of just getting supabase setup first.
Do debugging without AI.


### What are my challenges today?
Getting it done, because debugging is so much faster with AI but I'd like to build that muscle a little bit and not find myself dependant on AI all the time.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I did complete the next ticket!!! And I didn't use AI for any of the debugging which there was plenty of. It was fun and also confidence boosting as the skill hadn't atrophied as much as I had expected.


### What have I learned today?
I learned a lot about debugging SQL which I've never really had to do. I missed a few changes between my migrations and seed file data, so It was a simple search and replace. I learned that doing a v0 to local is more painful when you have mock data, something to think about for the next project.
