## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get the next ticket up completed. this one is bit complex and I blame using mock data instead of just getting supabase setup first.
Do debugging without AI.


### What are my challenges today?
Getting it done, because debugging is so much faster with AI but I'd like to build that muscle a little bit and not find myself dependant on AI all the time.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
