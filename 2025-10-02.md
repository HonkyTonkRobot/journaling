## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Make it through the day, get both bits of work I need done, done.


### What are my challenges today?
Navigating missing requirements, getting them pushed into production as quickly as possible without creating more work for myself. that fine line of MVP, but it's gotta work.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea I think so, road the wave, all the way in, got a lot done, never as much as I want to get done, but very pleased with how I navigated the day.

### What have I learned today?
The day's go differently than you expect, it's great when you come in weary and they turn out solid, and frustrating when you think they'll be smooth but they end in frustration.

## Journal
I've struggled with my journals this week, I think the pressure of the week has stopped it, and I just want to recognize that as it's a growth opportunity. Falter, but persevere and stay on the tracks. It's a rollercoaster and perfection is impossible.
