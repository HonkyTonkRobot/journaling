## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Make it through the day, get both bits of work I need done, done.


### What are my challenges today?
Navigating missing requirements, getting them pushed into production as quickly as possible without creating more work for myself. that fine line of MVP, but it's gotta work.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea I think so, road the wave, all the way in, got a lot done, never as much as I want to get done, but very pleased with how I navigated the day.

### What have I learned today?
The day's go differently than you expect, it's great when you come in weary and they turn out solid, and frustrating when you think they'll be smooth but they end in frustration.

## Journal
I've struggled with my journals this week, I think the pressure of the week has stopped it, and I just want to recognize that as it's a growth opportunity. Falter, but persevere and stay on the tracks. It's a rollercoaster and perfection is impossible.

### 2 second improvement
I've been working on my regolith setup for a few weeks now, and it's really starting to show dividends. With my custom keymap, I've been able to make my system keymaps work like vim. I created a normal mode that when I enter normal mode I can interact with my computer like I do with vimium/neovim. Basically is all of the keys that are mapped to the `super`, `mod`, `windows` keys which ever your system calls it, which is amazing because hitting that key is painful and was starting to give my thumb RSI. I keep finding new ones to add to my key map. Yesterday added quite a few around things like bluetooth, wifi, navigation of windows, and alot of these kind of work the same way as my vimium setup which is quite convienient. The only bad thing, is that I am not totally used to it yet, so I end up trying to type in a window and my computer starts doing crazy stuff. I have purposely not remapped shout down, so that I can't accidentally shut down my computer. :rofl:
