title: Getting somewhere with the RLS implementation
Date: 2025-07-29

description: It's hard working on a code base you are less familiar with. It has taken me so long to get up to speed with the architecture, as often projects come in with an architecture that is different than the company standard, for those projects that we're started before us.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Do some pairing with the senior lead on my team, to understand some problems I am having with the implementation of the project.


### What are my challenges today?
I'm starting to feel behind the 8 ball on this bit of work and we've got a hard deadline of next Friday, but I know it's important to not rush and to fully understand what I am going to get help on, because I will surely face it in future projects, and I'm a strong believer in "fast is slow, slow is fast" basically the idea of not rushing through something (this isn't always an option) and learning how to do it the right way so that on the next project I can be that much faster.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, solved the problem with help, and merged it in.


### What have I learned today?
I learned a lot more than I anticipated today. This newish to me code base follows a domain driven development OOP style of programming, which is very unfamiliar to me as all of my training and experience up until this point is with functional programming.

It was really difficult to get my head around but yesterday, had a bit of a breakthrough in understanding. really getting how the class blue print works to create new instances of an object that contain all of these domain related functions that can call each other and even be private ie. You call the a function from the class, inside that function calls a private function, that does something, gives it back to the function you called and returns the result. you never even know about the existance of the private function inside the class as it's not callable from outside of the instance of the class.

Basic breakdown
```js
// You have a class
export class Student {

  // Not sure but might need to start these variables here but not sure.
  name: string
  email: string

  constructor(name: string, email: string) {
    this.name = name
    this.email = email
  }

  addStudentToMathClass(name: string): void {
    addToDb(name)
    logActivity(`${name} added to db`)
  }

  private logActivity(activity: string): void {
    console.log(activity)
  }
}
```
Then when you call the function in another application
```js
const student1 = new Student("Alice", "alice@email.fake")

student1.addStudentToMathClass()
// all this does is add Alice and to the database, and returns nothing, except a console.log which goes through the logActivity private function. This is a non-sense way to do this but illustrates what I have learned or how wrong I have it :rofl: not sure which. Will keep learning.
```
