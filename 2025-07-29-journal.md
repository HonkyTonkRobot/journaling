title: Getting somewhere with the RLS implementation
Date: 2025-07-29
Author: Joel Anderson
description: It's hard working on a code base you are less familiar with. It has taken me so long to get up to speed with the architecture, as often projects come in with an architecture that is different than the company standard, for those projects that we're started before us.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Do some pairing with the senior lead on my team, to understand some problems I am having with the implementation of the project.


### What are my challenges today?
I'm starting to feel behind the 8 ball on this bit of work and we've got a hard deadline of next Friday, but I know it's important to not rush and to fully understand what I am going to get help on, because I will surely face it in future projects, and I'm a strong believer in "fast is slow, slow is fast" basically the idea of not rushing through something (this isn't always an option) and learning how to do it the right way so that on the next project I can be that much faster.
