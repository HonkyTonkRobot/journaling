## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Keep churning out features. Yesterday was super productive and want to keep that up today.


### What are my challenges today?
I think it's asking for clarity today.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea absolutely really solid day and really enjoying this week. I'm working back on a project that I built from 0, so I am really familiar with the code base and really enjoying it.


### What have I learned today?
I feel like my learning is stalling a little bit because I have been using AI to heavily augment my work for productivity reasons, and not sure where to focus my learning. Also my mental capacity has been heavily focused on setting up claudsidian, find some linux based voice to text stuff, setting up a home server, getting claude code running in termius on my phone so I can open claudesidian in my servers terminal, and chat to it, and have it make notes and documents in my obisidian vault. So I have been intentionally shifting my learning focus, but need to bring it back as I want to ensure I am still learning and not just getting way to dependent on AI especially in such a pivotal point in my learning journey.

## Journal
Feeling a bit lost today, and I think it's because I've been moving through a bunch of different projects, so lot of brain tax to switch the context. Also, feeling a strong use of AI lately which I think is tough, because I think my learning about coding is slowing down, but my ability to use AI to write good code is really increasing. The tools I've been using are getting more and more sophisticated, and seeing the results are increasing better. It's not the models that have gotten better, but just my ability to guide it through custom slash commands.
