## Journal
Feeling a bit lost today, and I think it's because I've been moving through a bunch of different projects, so lot of brain tax to switch the context. Also, feeling a strong use of AI lately which I think is tough, because I think my learning about coding is slowing down, but my ability to use AI to write good code is really increasing. The tools I've been using are getting more and more sophisticated, and seeing the results are increasing better. It's not the models that have gotten better, but just my ability to guide it through custom slash commands.
