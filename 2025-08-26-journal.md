### What are my challenges today?
Look at that list, holy crap is that a challenge. Let's see if I've got the muscle

Not getting distracted. I've already found a distraction in wispr.flow. I want to try talking to my computer to see what that's like. (I love typing though so, I imagine as a tool like LLM coding assistants. I'll use them, but not all the time.
