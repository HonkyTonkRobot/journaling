title: Another day another bug
Date: 2025-12-03

description: I love making a codebase better. As a newbie I feel like I learn the most when I am refactoring, as it means I learn the right way to do things and can fix my mistakes, and more importantly learn how to do it right from the start on the next project.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Today is mostly bug hunting, looking for errors in the application, hunting the source of them and fixing them.

### What are my challenges today?
I guess not having a task to start the day, but feeling ok about it. I am afraid I will get pulled off of what I am doing because that sometimes happens when something more urgent pops up, and these not blocking bug fixes get deprioritized. That's just a part of it I guess.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
