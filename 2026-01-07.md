## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Knock out 4 tickets. I was given a really fun task of a load of very small tickets and to use AI to try and get each ticket as far as I can in 2 hours. Document where I've gotten to, and leave it for the Senior team to finish off. Really interesting strategy, and keen to see how it goes.


### What are my challenges today?
I think the time boxing will be the challenge. My process tends to be one piece flow, minimal WIP. This is very much the opposite of that but I think the idea is to get me to be forced to MVP it, and not over think it. over process it, over spend energy reviewing my work. Also all of these tickets are really tiny things (on paper at least :rofl:).


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
A big no. I ran into a technical problem that kept causing my computer to crash. I wasted half a day just trying to fix it and it's still not fixed. I think this may have been the worst day so far in my career as a programmer.

### What have I learned today?
~Resitance~Life is futile. tomorrow is another day.

## Journal
Wow, what a finish to 2025, and a start to 2026.

**I set out with two 90 goals.**
I feel like it's been 90 days but not really sure I didn't set a deadline.
1. Get back into fitness
2. Ramp up my te reo learning

### 90 goal progress
#### Fitness
I have gotten into a fitness routine. I am not super consistent but I am working out more and I am stoked. I also got an ADHD diagnosis, which has been life changing. I've always had an unhealthly relationship with food. (over eating) I've always been very snacky, and the kind of person that get's 2-3 portions of dinner. Ever since starting medication, I have noticed my sleep is better, My ability to hold my attention in coversations, and the most wild change to me is I can actually notice when I am fully, and can stop before I overeat. I'm still pretty snacky but I imagine that's 20 years of bad habits.

For the first time in years I'm actually seeing results from exercise, because I am doing that other part, which is not over consuming kai.

#### Te reo Māori
I already mentioned noticing I was starting to have a lot of te reo Māori vocabulary (kupu) and this really made me double down on learning. My partner got a two year's ago photo thing on here phone for new years, and one of the videos was of me trying to count to 10 in te reo and boy was I on the struggle bus (pahi). Now I am playing a game on my phone called `tatau` which is a te reo counting game, and I am easily counting or more like translating with ease numbers up to a million (kotahi mirione)

I've started learning grammar and constructing basic sentences, and have basically just learning any new thing I come across that I don't know the word for. I'm trying thr strategy of overloading my brain, and more sticking but knowing some of it will fall out of brain. I've probably learned every word in the kitchen 20 times but never remember half of the words for various things in the kitchen. I have found breaking down the words or tying it to something else really helps me learn it. ie balloon is poihau. A reductive description of a poi is a ball on a string, and hau is the word for wind, so poihau is ball of air on a string. which makes it really easy to remember sense I already had poi and hau strongly remembered. Same for Penquin. I had so much trouble remembering it (kororā) which is the combining of throat (koro) and sun/day/now (rā) which I don't really know how the etomology of why that combo was made but i konw those two words so if I think throat sun it makes me remember it. One day it will become natural and not a process to remember :rofl: similar for giraffe which has a phonetic transcription or transliteration, but also has a more naturally te reo word kakāroa. kakā is neck and you may have guess roa is length or long. so a giraffe is long neck which is funny enough the name of the Dinosaur in "The Land Before Time" movie which also has a really long neck. I loved that movie.

I also found that typing in te reo is really hard on an english keyboard, and was shocked that a better solution was not natively out there. On Windows to type vowels with macrons you have to hit the ~ key + the vowel, and if you want to do a capital macron vowel you have to hit ~ + Shift + vowel :eyes: which is horrible for typing at speed. It's a little bit better on linux (what I use) The key is alt instead of the ~ but it's still not great especially for captilized macron vowels. This is a long intro to a made my own key mapping for te reo that I'll be making into an open-source project as I don't feel like making all the different platforms, I'm just making it work for me, and opening it up as a discussion for it to be improved and moved to multiple different platforms.

I've mostly done this as I love doing typing tests and my preferred typing test app is MonkyType which has Māori as an option.

It's pretty hard to learn a new keyboard, but I'm really pleased with what I've come up with. The basic gist is that every letter gets it's own key ie. all vowel macron's have seperate keys so no alt or ~ to get to the macrons which this is easy to do because there's only 9 constants and 10 vowels which includes the macron vowels on seperate keys. with 26 keys for english makes it pretty easy. Also because te reo has a pretty consistent structure of constant > vowel > constant > vowel you can make a pretty optimized keyboard for one key alternating hand key presses which makes speed faster by putting vowels on one hand and constants on the other hand. I opted for having vowels left, and constants right. home row left having the 5 vowels, top row left having the 5 macron vowels aligned straight above their matching standard vowel. There was some optimization of order due to there are many back to back vowels in te reo so making sure to optimize to reduce bigraphs which means back to back same finger key presses. like what happens when you need to type "gr" or "nu" on a standard english qwerty keyboard. On the right side you don't have as much of a concern about this except for your digraphs "wh" and "ng" which I have enough room to make typing both but I didn't want to do that as it feels a bit unatural for typing because I've been typing english my whole typing life. but because there's only ever those two it was very easy to order them in a way that is very easy to type those back to back. i'll put a map in a later post once I've played with it more and really got it flying. right now I can only type 26wpm with it, but once my brain gets the muscle memory I think I'll easy be typing at 100wpm, which is aproximately my english typing speed. Contrast I can only type 30wpm in te reo on an english qwerty keyboard and that's with extremely good muscle memory on the english qwerty keyboard.

### Grammar
#### Tense
`ka` future or starting now
`kei te` present tense
`i` past
`kua` perfect/past perfect or I guess you would say a thing has happened.
I think these almost always come at the beginning of a sentence, and are are immediately proceeded by a verb.

`he` an indefinite marker for a noun, like saying a dog = he kurī
`ko` a definite marker for a noun, like saying the dog ie. ko kurī and this I think is only used when the person speaking and the listener both konw what the person is talking about. ie. The teacher is John, both people would know what teacher was from context provided earlier in the conversation. I probably have that wrong :rofl:

Theres a bunch of other grammar, but I'm going to stop here for today, because I've already been writing this journal for an hour and still have more I want to say.

#### Going forward
I am going to start writing some of my journal in te reo to increase my exposure to the language, and to practice my new keyboard layout. or additionally adding in some vocab in parenthesis.

### Back to the journaling
One thing back to the journaling, i think my journey has been sustainable because I havent' forced it I;ve just let myself learn over the last two years, and now I am seeing the moment escalate exponentially because of that steady growth.
