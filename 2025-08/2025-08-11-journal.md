title: 2 second improvement
Date: 2025-08-11
Author: Joel Anderson
description: I try and make a 2 second improvement to my process everyday. I think of it like fighting entropy. The work environment is getting more and more chaotic, causing more and more friction in getting work done. By making a 2 second improvement, which compounds everyday, reduces that friction so I can stay focused on the higher leverage tasks. If I can save seconds everytime I need to make a commit, the savings overtime is huge. If I can start this journal and already have a template to get started, I don't have to spend the congnative energy on setting up the journal again. The current set of improvements I am working on creating a richer git navigation in my terminal/neovim setup so that I can be more productive with git.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get some domain DNS stuff finished off
2. Start this process
- Bonus is getting some learning in using Figma First Draft in my process.


### What are my challenges today?
1. I think staying focused and productive because I am coming into a week without much direction, so I could end up being pulled in several directions.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
learning things about zod schema
```javascript
const registerSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
  confirmPassword: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
}).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"],
})
```
If I have a zod Schema like the above I can then create a new TypeScript type by infering it from the schema.
```typescript
type registrationData = z.infer<typeof registerSchema>
```
Now instead of creating a new type that follows the same format of the schema, I get that benefit with this single line of code. and can use this type on my form, that will inforce the schema. So now there's a single source of truth the schema and the types come from the same place.

`z.infer<>` is a Zod utility that extracts the data type from successfully parsing the schema.

#### Supabase
I did some learning on setting up SupaBase's email invitation system. Though (It's the next day) I don't really remember much. I think this is the first time I have really felt AI as hindering my learning, not because It wasn't being useful, but because I was having a low energy day, and wasn't as engaged as I needed to be. I think my reflection on that is that when that happens I just need to turn Claude off, and read the docs.

## Journal
Wow yesterday I really did some playing with my neovim config. I added `gitsigns`, `neogit`, and `diffview` added settings removed settings. Watched a ton of youtube videos, read a bunch of docs, and in the end not really much futher than when I started. I mean I guess I am because I understand what these tools do for me, I', really liking the features I am getting from gitsigns and from diffview, but not yes sure if I like neogit. It's super powerful and is more vim like expressive the running git commands in the terminal, but I think it's a bit further from what I would like it to be. Considering installing lazygit as I've read good things, but I've sunk enough time in this week, and keen to just sit with what I have for now.
