description: New project v0 to production in 4 days. Crazy Challenge, but it's going to happen. This will really put what I've learned over the last 3 months to the test.
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get All of the Supabase features up and running today!!!!!
    - [ ] login flow
    - [ ] signup flow
    - [ ] reset password flow
    - [ ] db schema
    - [ ] supabase integration
    - [ ] RLS policies
    - [ ] Dev tools (scripts, config.toml, etc)


### What are my challenges today?
Look at that list, holy crap is that a challenge. Let's see if I've got the muscle

Not getting distracted. I've already found a distraction in wispr.flow. I want to try talking to my computer to see what that's like. (I love typing though so, I imagine as a tool like LLM coding assistants. I'll use them, but not all the time.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Not yet, I've made some crazy progress, but was doing some v0 work that I wasn't anticipating needing to do. It's crazy how fast v0 is getting better. It's already so much better than it was a month ago. What I was able to achieve with it was pretty cool.

I didn't achieve my goals but I achieved a bunch of other stuff I didn't even realize I needed to do. :sweat_smile:


### What have I learned today?
I have learned that my LLM workflows are getting stronger and faster every month. What took me a month on my first project, took me two weeks on my second project, one week on my third project, and this project I'm hoping to have up in about 12-13 hours. I am definitely building off my knowledge from past projects so I know what to do and what mistakes to avoid. one of the nice things about doing client work it means I get a lot of reps in on building production ready full-stack applications.

Some cool new features of v0
1. 2 way github sync. So I can push stuff to github, bring it locally, develop, push, pull into v0, vibe away, etc.
2. UI targeted editing with a GUI (sort of webflow feel) Also makes it really easy to jump to the code to make code edits and not waste credits on stupid little UI tweaks.
3. You can add knowledge, what is essentially the system prompt you can tell it your tech stack, how you want the code to be structured etc. Really useful. The last time I used v0 I was annoyed at the many 1000+ line files it created, and this time I was able to tell it to aim for less than 400 lines per file, and it was able to actually do that which meant my refactor when brought locally took about 2 hours instead of days.
