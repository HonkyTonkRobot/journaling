## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get this email flow working, ahhhhh! that is all
Submit talk for the NZ tech Rally


### What are my challenges today?
not reaching out for help. I've gotta reach out for help more when I am getting stuck. I've got really talented developers on my team that have done this exact thing before, so I need to lean on them a bit more than I have. It can be hard to reach out because I've always needed to prove I can do it. which has helped me have a learners mindset, but it actually doesn't optimize my learning.By getting someone to just show you the right way. or help you break through something that is blocking you.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I submitted a talk for the NZ tech rally :muscle: Really excited even if I don't get it. Just proud of myself for applying. Now the real work starts

**I DID IT!!!!** After banging my head against the table for hours, I finally was able to work out why the invite email flow wasn't working. (solution in the learnings)

### What have I learned today?
So I finally figured out what the problem was. SupaBase has this function (that lives in supabase) called `setSession()` which basically creates the cookie for the logged in user to persist while they are using the website. Well I was expecting this function to return something that told the frontend yep this user is logged in please continue, but that's not how it works. I was awaiting this function before returning the page which isn't needed because the auth is already checked from the JWT token being passed from the invite link. the `setSession()` was just making it persist. So because nothing was returned the loading screen was just hanging waiting for `setSession()` to do it's thing. once I removed the `async`, `await` and let it fire and continue everything worked fine. Hours of debugging, but it the end I'm happy for the journey because I figured out way more about SupaBase, and feel like I understand it on a much deeper level.

## Journal
I am so glad I found out about neovim. Talking to a dev friend I asked what IDE they used and they said VIM. "what's that?" they said don't worry about it just use vscode maybe explore vim later. This just tickled something in my brain, I had to know what this thing was I was told not to do. Almost like someone suggesting I couldn't do it (I know that's not what they meant) made me want to find out more.

I watched a YouTube video on Vim and signed up for Vim Adventures (pretty fun game), and started exploring what vim is. I was already doing journaling with markdown, so I decided to start doing my journaling in markdown in vim to practice Vim. This turned out to be great! This was before I even started to learn to code. It gave me a pretty easy start because I already knew markdown. Then by the time I started at Dev Academy I was pretty good at the basic vim motions. And then going back to talk to those friends they were like oh wow you learned it? cool! That's when they introduced me to NeoVim which is basicallly a version of vim that has tons of opensource plugins that allows you to customize how you work in vim.

### Things I love about it.
1. I work straight in the terminal
2. I can really customize it how I want, unlike any piece of software, like really customize it, the UI, the way menus display, it's incredible.
3. I am doing this by coding in Lua, which I don't know very well but am learning through having the interest to tinker with my config, to get it just how I like. Making 2 second improvements to my workflow by making my neovim config match my workflow.

You might be thinking you can customize VScode pretty heavily, but it's really just a different experience. I'd recommend trying it, but I would suggest just throwing out your current IDE with the bath water. Play Vim adventures, then slowly start moving over to it.

### Getting to my point for today's journal.
I spent all evening improving my neovim config. I had been working with all my code in 3 800+ line files, and it was getting overwelhming so I refactored it to be more modular putting every plugin in it's own separate file. Now I feel like when I am tweaking a plugin I can have the clear brainspace and not get all jumbled by the 800 lines of code. Also means I don't need to scroll endlessly.

**Best (and Worst) Time to Be a Junior: Lessons from My First Year with AI**
Joel Anderson shares his first year as an “AI-native” junior developer in a rapidly evolving industry. He explores what’s exhilarating and what’s challenging, why teams should hire juniors now, and how to support them to grow fast—through mentorship, careful code review, and using AI as a teaching tool. It’s Joel’s second time entering a profession mid-transformation, offering a unique perspective on thriving when the tools—and the rules—are changing fast.

### outline

I want to start with something like: I have never known what it is like to be a developer without AI. Dev Academy to conference to first job to three full stack apps in production in months. Just get the audience thinking: is that normal? (Spoiler: no). Mention that this is not my first time entering to an industry when the tools were flipping everything upside down.

#### what it is like to be a junior right now
Talk about the exposure level. Every day I am coming across whole topics I did not even know existed because AI suggests something, I research it, and I have opened another door. Compare that to what I imagine a junior’s life used to be: more time on syntax errors, less time on architecture and patterns. Mention how I can push meaningful PRs fast because AI handles the rough draft work and I get to shape it.

#### the good stuff
Speed to contribution. My first month I was adding features that actually went to production. Confidence boost because I could see my code in the wild fast. No hang ups about writing it all myself. If AI helps me learn and ship, I will take it. The breadth of exposure. I am seeing a wider range of stacks, tools, and approaches much earlier in my career than I thought possible.

#### the not so good stuff
Shallow understanding trips me up sometimes. It is easy to trust AI’s answer without digging. Tool dependency. What happens when the AI is wrong or makes something up? And I do not get as many manual reps at debugging small problems, so that muscle might grow slower. Sometimes AI gives code that works but is not great, and you do not notice unless you have a senior reviewing closely.

#### why teams should be hiring juniors now
Lower cost of onboarding because AI shortens the ramp. Juniors like me can add value in weeks, not months. We do not have old habits to unlearn. It is just part of the workflow. We bring a different perspective. We are seeing the industry from inside the AI wave, not from the outside looking in.

#### Section 5 — how to support juniors so they grow fast
Mentorship is still huge. Encourage using AI as a teacher, not just a crutch. Ask why it made a choice. Keep commits small so review is easier and learning is faster. Seniors should still do peer review because otherwise bad habits sneak in. Sometimes force us to work in manual mode so we understand what is going on under the hood.

#### closing
Circle back to my second time in an industry mid shakeup. In both cases, the people who thrived were the ones who adapted to the tools without losing sight of the craft. Wrap it up with a nudge. If we want strong seniors in five years, we need to invest in strong juniors today.
