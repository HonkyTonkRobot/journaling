description: I missed yesterday because I did a big entry in the morning for the day befores journal. another reason to get the day's journal done on the day.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Get this Invite User flow finished. I got it done on one app, and needed to get it done on another app, but in a slightly different way, and proved to be more of a pain than expected. I guess it's just another opportunity to learn the in's and out's of SupaBase. It's funny how everytime you learn a new thing you realize how much you don't actually know. :rofl:

### What are my challenges today?
Challenges are wrapping this up. I've gone over on my timeboxing for this but it has to be done to ship the app.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
A few days have passed and didn't finish this journal. I got sick. I getting some good lessons in what happens when you push something to tomorrow. Though I am making calculated trade-offs. ie. quality time with family. More thoughts on this in the journal below.

### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I feel like I need to re-think my strategy for getting these end of day questions done. I want to complete them same day to lock in the learnings but, I am struggling to achieve this goal. I often say good design, makes the desired behavior the easiest choice. ie. If we want our team to follow health and safety practices how do we make that easier than not following health and safety practices.

If I am not getting my journals done same day, how do I identify what is blocking, me and make it the easy choice.

### Reason's I am not completing them (excuses :rofl:)
1. forgetting about them entirely
2. Getting to the end of the day, and it's family time, but then not prioritizing it after the family has gone to sleep.
3. feeling like it's a chore at the end of the day.
    - If I learned anything from the book `Tiny Habits` it's that it can't feel like a chore it's gotta give you a dopamine hit every time you do it, if you want to keep doing it.
    - This is why when I find it nagging at me, how do I turn that around and make it something that I can't wait to do.
    - I have goals with my journaling
        1. lock in my learning
        2. Practice writing
        3. ~~building~~ Growing in public
        4. make writing natural so I can start blogging
        5. build my confidence

### So what do I do? _Any ideas are welcome (if you have an idea it would be hilarious if you open an issue on the repo)_
1.I could timebox it in my calendar, and have a reminder but I think that will lead to a nagging feeling and reinforce a negative feeling everytime I skip it.
2.don't sweat the small things, and be proud of myself for every day that I get back on the horse, but I want this, so how do I make the behavior I want the easy thing.
3. Build in a few breaks during the day where I do a little bit, I need to take breaks during the day anyways. **I like this one**
:thinking: It's hilarious typing this out streaming thought style
I'm out of ideas, I'm gonna let it percolate and see if anything else comes up.
