description: I'm not sure why feeling low energy this week. I need to find that inspiration this week, or find the part I am enjoying and focus on that.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Find the part that gives me joy today.  Don't focus to hard on the outcomes, just pick one thing and focus on progress.


### What are my challenges today?
Energy levels for sure. I'm not sure what it's about, I'm happy, enjoying my work, and have meaningful work to do that I am learning from, but just feeling mentally distracted.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Partially, it ended up being a very productive day. Though I changed my leader key in my wezTerm config, and that is proving to be some tough muscle memory to break.

I also, did add learnings on the day.

### What have I learned today?
I can't remember :( I did a lot of work on Supabase migrations and fixing security Advisories in the supabase dashboard, but I can't remember in detail what I really learned, but today is a new day.
