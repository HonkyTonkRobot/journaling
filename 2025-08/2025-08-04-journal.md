description: It's the last full week before launch, this week is just about smashing stuff out, and hopefullyu not creating to much tech debt from just pumping it out.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Finish off my PR that I didn't quite get deployed because I forgot to `run build` :eyes:
Then the task will be finding the next bug, or hopefully magically their will be no other bugs, but I know that won't happen.

### What are my challenges today?
I realize I missed my mission from Thursday, I was supposed to find all of the bugs document them, and then we strategically complete them based on the time remaining. Instead I found and fixed them one at a time. So today is all about finishing what I was tasked with.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
1. I did! I finished the QA process and Identified a list of bugs to fix.
2. I also, was able to stay on task and not venture down to rabbit hole/feature creep.  Though what I though was a simple bug fix, ended up being so much more complicated, because the architecture of our mono-repo had two different patterns, that needed to me DRY'd out during the refactor/fix. I know that sounds like feature creep but, it really was the only way to fix the bug.

### What have I learned today?
This is the next day, and sadly feel like I have forgotten everything I learned yesterday. I guess one thing I can reflect on is getting a much better "spidey sense" for when Claude Code is going of the rails. Also, starting to understand where it's limits are. There better your repo is setup and the more modular it is, the easier it seems to be for Claude to keep up, where as when you have everything in a couple files, it has a much harder time. I find this is a function of using v0.dev to vibe code a starting point, and then not taking the time to refactor it into a modular DRY repo before further development. I've noticed v0 tends to put everything frontend into one file like the page.tsx and all of the backend into a single file, this creates these unwieldy 1000+ line files that become really hard for me to follow as a junior dev. I find when stuff is broken down into seperate files, it's way easier for me to follow, especially if the function and variable names are well named and descriptive of their utility.

I remembered something else I learned. We use the gemini pr review bot, and once you have fixed the review comments, you can get gemini to re-review it by using a `/gemini` slash command followed by some context like review or help etc.
