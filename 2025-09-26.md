description: It's been a week of refactoring, UI/UX improvements, and hopefully today, get to doing an accessability evaluation plan.
---

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- finish current UI/UX improvements
- test admin side routes of the app for regressions
- Evaluate and improve app accessibility

### What are my challenges today?
That's a lot and today is a short day because I did a 10hr day yesterday, because I was in the zone. I got a good sleep and I am feeling good, so hopefully that translates to getting into a flow state today too.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Absolutetly, It was one of those beautiful days where everything was just flowing, and finished, deployed it live for the client at closing time almost right on the dot. Though I expect on Monday, to have a list of bugs I didn't see :rofl:

### What have I learned today?
Hard to pinpoint what I learned today, just more reinforcement learning that, when you AI assisted/vibe code you gotta refactor as you go, because it makes it easier for the AI assistant to follow your existing codebase patterns and if you don't refactor it will follow the bad existing patterns which makes it harder to revert. The other bit of reinforcement learning was that when you start a vibe coded project, don't put in the bells and whistles. No filters, no nice to have features, make it the pure bare bone skeleton of the project you want it to be. Seems counter intuitive but this will help you get your codebase started on the right track, Claude code or whatever ide assistant you use is perfectlly capable of adding those features, but you will have more fine grained control of adding it. I should caviat that this is highly dependant on the purpose of your vibe coded starting point, If you just need a high fidelity prototype, definetly just do it in v0 or your preferred vibe coding tool, but if you want it to be the starting point of the real thing, I recommend keeping it bare bones. On that front I've been thinking about giving a solid second shot to Figma Make because it really focuses on the frontend code, it obviously has the full stack to make it work, but it really only shows you the front end code, I found this frustrating last time, but now I kind of like it. I think I'll make all of my frontend screens then, move that locally and connect the plumbing with cluade code, though I've also heard that codex CLI is great now with ChatGPT 5.

## Journal

### 2 second improvement
This morning I woke up at 5am feeling great, and decided to tinker with my Regolith swayland setup. I focused on my taskbar, as I didn't like the location of the date, and it didn't have a battery indicator, I also added an `-- Normal --` flag for when I've got regolith in normal mode, which essentially means I just don't have to use the `mod`/`super` key, which is handy because I am starting to get some RSI in my left thumb from hitting the `super` key so often.
