Author: Joel Anderson
description: It's been a week of refactoring, UI/UX improvements, and hopefully today, get to doing an accessability evaluation plan.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- finish current UI/UX improvements
- test admin side routes of the app for regressions
- Evaluate and improve app accessibility

### What are my challenges today?
That's a lot and today is a short day because I did a 10hr day yesterday, because I was in the zone. I got a good sleep and I am feeling good, so hopefully that translates to getting into a flow state today too.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal

### 2 second improvement
This morning I woke up at 5am feeling great, and decided to tinker with my Regolith swayland setup. I focused on my taskbar, as I didn't like the location of the date, and it didn't have a battery indicator, I also added an `-- Normal --` flag for when I've got regolith in normal mode, which essentially means I just don't have to use the `mod`/`super` key, which is handy because I am starting to get some RSI in my left thumb from hitting the `super` key so often.
