description: I'm working on an internal project, but it doesn't always feel real without context. Well some context was given yesterday, as we have a project that will use the tool. So it has me really excited to get it working.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
I am stoked to get working on the current internal project. today's goal is to get the the email flow working through supabase. If I get that done then I'll move on to finishing writing up my lightning talk on all of the things I've learned about SupaBase to share with my team. I've learned so much, In the past 3 months that I'll probably have to break it down in to multiple lightning talks for it to actually be valuable.


### What are my challenges today?
Pushing. It's easy to sit back when your working on internal projects but I just gotta remember the context, and how great it will be when I've finished this project. So onward and forward.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Not at all. Yesterday was spent mostly banging my head against the table. Read a load of docs, searched forums discussing the problem. Took several shots with Claude Code, should of switched over to a different API like GEMINI get a different opinion, Rubber Duckied it. Next step is to pull in the big guns on my team :rofl: and get some help.


### What have I learned today?
What I learned, I learned heaps about setting up an email flow for new users using the SupaBase email flow and auth, but I was how learning goes when it's really hard you retain the knowledge much better. So I'll let you know when I get there. I also had the reinforced learning that often AI is really crap at solving new problems. It's really good at stuff that has been around and has lots of online references, but it can be pretty crap at things that are less common.

## Journal
stoked to already have made my two second improvement, and it truly is a 2 second improvement. So I have a journal template I use to kickstart this process each day, And for all of the journal entries since Jan 2. I've been going into the `TEMPLATE.md` `:w <new-journal>` writing it to a new file. `:Ex` exiting to the directory, and opening the new file. I find this annoying and finally looked up the command for making the file and jumping to it straight away. I can't believe it took me this long to do it. I wasn't following the cardinal rule of `2 second improvements` "fix what bugs you". The new command is `:saveas` or `:sav` just like any word document when you do this it makes a new file and jumps to that new file immediately. I might even make a `<leader>sa` key to save one key stroke but I like doing `:` commands for things like saving. I don't like making the base vim keys custom as it will make it harder to use `vanilla` VIM when on someone elses computer. similar reason I don't make my keybard colmac or something like that.
