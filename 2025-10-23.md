## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals, to finish off this feature I've been working on the last 3 days. I realised I make a bad architectural decision, and should have reached out to my team earlier as maybe it could have been avoided, but I do find I learn a lot more when I make mistakes so think it has been valuable, but just has taken way more time than it should have and has put me behind schedule.


### What are my challenges today?
Just staying focused as I've got a few maintenance tasks on two of the projects I maintain, so need to execute those, and keep focused on the current project.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
No, infact today was painful. I reached the point of deciding to completely start over on this feature. I built it wrong, and then tried refactoring it, and did build what I wanted but I created so many bugs during the refactor that I have decided it's best to go back to square one and reimplement from a clean slate. I atleast have the plan solid because I'll do the same thing I planned for the refactor but it just turns out I should have done this from the start of today, instead of trying to refactor out the bad implementation. Lesson learned, but I'm still bummed about it.

### What have I learned today?
When you find out what you did isn't going to work, don't try and refactor from there creating more tech debt, and dead code, just start fresh, and implement strategy 2.


## Journal
I am really stoked that I was invited to speak to my peers in the Dev Grad community discord. A mostly NZ based discord of Software Devs, many of us have been through the same software bootcamp `Dev Academy` over the last 5 or so years.

I got to share my first 5 months of experience working for an AI native software development agency, and how that is shaping my learning journey as a software dev. Both the good and the bad, and how I am actively managing the bad parts.

It was a bit nerve racking, but instantly became fun once starting the talk, as everyone was really supportive, and people had great questions which really made it engaging.

I also, got a change to practice my public speaking as that is a thing I have actively wanted to improve, and think I have an interesting story as a person retraining and entering a new field at a time of big distruption or change.
