## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals, to finish off this feature I've been working on the last 3 days. I realised I make a bad architectural decision, and should have reached out to my team earlier as maybe it could have been avoided, but I do find I learn a lot more when I make mistakes so think it has been valuable, but just has taken way more time than it should have and has put me behind schedule.


### What are my challenges today?
Just staying focused as I've got a few maintenance tasks on two of the projects I maintain, so need to execute those, and keep focused on the current project.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I am really stoked that I was invited to speak to my peers in the Dev Grad community discord. A mostly NZ based discord of Software Devs, many of us have been through the same software bootcamp `Dev Academy` over the last 5 or so years.

I got to share my first 5 months of experience working for an AI native software development agency, and how that is shaping my learning journey as a software dev. Both the good and the bad, and how I am actively managing the bad parts.

It was a bit nerve racking, but instantly became fun once starting the talk, as everyone was really supportive, and people had great questions which really made it engaging.

I also, got a change to practice my public speaking as that is a thing I have actively wanted to improve, and think I have an interesting story as a person retraining and entering a new field at a time of big distruption or change.
