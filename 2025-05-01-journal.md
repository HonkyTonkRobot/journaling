## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To get the tickets issued, and to create a wireframe of the app. I also need to identify a job, and apply or send an expression of interest.

### What are my challenges today?
Getting my goals done. I found yesterday hard to complete my goals.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I did!

### What have I learned today?
1. I learned how to make a template project in GitHub, so any custom labels or other settings I have made can be carried over to future projects.
2. I improved my skills with Figma, also learning you can create components, so when you reuse a design, making one change to the original will be carried over to all other instances.  
   I feel like I've learned other things, but they are slipping my mind.

I'm going to use GitHub Projects for my Kanban, mainly because I'm pretty seasoned on Trello WIP boards and want to get better at the GitHub flow, learn its advantages and weaknesses.

Working through getting things set up. Some improvements for next week's project could be:
1. Creating a timebox table in the wiki
2. Adding a file structure diagram

Thinking about what I want for the CV-share app.
- I want to capture some data about the person requesting access  
  - (need a privacy policy, info about how the info is being stored)
- I want it to be super basic design-wise. Will use Chakra UI to make it nice and easy, as CSS is not the focus of this practice
- I thought about requiring email but figured that might create too much friction. So instead, just getting full name and company, optionally a link to their LinkedIn profile.
