## Idea Pitch
one page app for sharing my CV. User want's my CV and I want to be able to follow up with user. Super simple form for grabbing name, email, and company, before displaying CV and providing a downloadable version.

### What I need to make it happen
1. Boiler-plate project template from Dev Academy
  - Will have me pretty well setup to make a full stack app
2. Wiki about details of the project
  - Helps me start thinking about the processes companies may already have.
3. Figma wireframe
  - build a quick and dirty wireframe
4. I don't need Auth, but I do need to make sure the database is server side and not accessible, so need to study up on that. I think I already know, but I'd like to be sure.
5. Break the project down to issues, and setup a project in GitHub.
6. figuring out hosting a document for download
7. Figure out how to do my own dokku deployment, so that it's not dependent on Dev Acadmey
  - I reckon I would need to look into some kind of hosting like `Catalyst Cloud` and
8. For the front-end going to keep it real simple and use Chakra-ui
9. database, going to keep using sqlite and thing about trying to use postgres in future projects.
10. I need to build a time-boxed schedule to make sure I complete it in the time-frame of what I've got planned.

**Go time**
