## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals finish off my first ticket on a new to me project. It's probably one of our longest running most mature codebases which means theres a lot to learn, but with the incredible team lead I am really stoked, additionally, they have given me some great first ticket's to help me get stuck in without too much baggage of learning the very complex codebase.


### What are my challenges today?
getting over the fear of breaking things or doing something wrong. I am keen to do more work on this codebase so I have the hesitation of making a mistake, also this is a very live site with lots of daily users so, one in mistakes I make will probably be picked up in the very thorough QA process, but I still have a fear of making mistakes.

## Journal
### 90 Day update
I'm not sure when this 90 days actually started, but I am making significant progress with both my fitness and my te reo Māori.  I worked out with my workout accountability parter yesterday, and feeling stoked about that. last week I did fewer 10min lunchtime workouts, but did lots of biking and, running. For my te reo practice I am still listening to podcasts, and a friend introduced me to another great podcast which is more about learning the language instead of learning about te ao Māori (the Māori world) which I get to listen to a lot of te reo Māori. I've also been learning heaps of new words and learning more sentence structure. Yestday I learned the days of the week in the Māorified versions [^1] There is an interesting discourse among Māori language scholars about which version should be used. the Ngā Rā o te wiki, or the transliterations/loan words/kupu arotau. As days of the week are a western/pākia concept, and have no whakapapa, but others say there are other examples of stranslating western concepts using words that are already a part of the Māori langauge ie. toa hokomaha toa (is a stransliteration for shop, it's Māori meaning is more representive of strength) hoko means to buy, and maha means be many, so toa hokomaha translates to the shop where you buy many things. I really like this way of describing a concept that was introduced by the western world, but is more true to the Māori language. Not that I really get to have an opinion as tangata te Tiriti but I think this is cool way to do it. Anyways here are the days of the week

#### Ngā Rā o te wiki
- Rāhine  - Monday, Pays tribute to the "Day of the Moon (luna)"
- Rātū    - Tuesday, Pays tribute to the "Day of Mars"
- Rāapa   - Wednesday, Pays tribute to the "Day of Mercury"
- Rāpare  - Thursday, Pays tribute to the "Day of Jupiter"
- Rāmere  - Friday, Pays tribute to the "Day of Venus"
- Rāhoroi - Saturday  This one easy to remember because basically translates to "Washing Day" But it is meant to pay tribute to the "Day of Saturn"
- Rātapu  - Sunday  This one too, becuase it could mean "sacred day" which is common in many religions, though it is meant to pay tribute to the "Day of Sun (sol)"
