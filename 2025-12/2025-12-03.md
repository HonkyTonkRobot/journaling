description: I love making a codebase better. As a newbie I feel like I learn the most when I am refactoring, as it means I learn the right way to do things and can fix my mistakes, and more importantly learn how to do it right from the start on the next project.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Today is mostly bug hunting, looking for errors in the application, hunting the source of them and fixing them.

### What are my challenges today?
I guess not having a task to start the day, but feeling ok about it. I am afraid I will get pulled off of what I am doing because that sometimes happens when something more urgent pops up, and these not blocking bug fixes get deprioritized. That's just a part of it I guess.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea today was a big day with Vercel informing everyone about a major security bug, so getting our clients codebases updated was top priority. Additionally was able to get a refactor of our testing suite for one of our repos. It felt great to know what was wrong and to be able to just tackle it. It had it's roadblocks, but it mostly went smoothly.

### What have I learned today?
That I am growing, even when I am heavily assisted by AI. I think my practice of doing some manual coding everyday, and keeping my pr's below 600 lines of addition, means I have the context window :rofl: to evaluate my code and ensure I understand it, And often poke holes in it. I'm getting better and better and spotting code smells and digging into them, and getting solid explanations from Claude.
