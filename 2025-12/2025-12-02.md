## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Do some bug hunting. Try to find some edge cases that users may run into.

### What are my challenges today?
Pr creep. I have done a great job yesterday making two under 500 lines of change pr's which always feels nice. I know with a refactor this can easily balloon if I start chasing rabbits.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea, absolutely fixed a long running performance bug, that we haven't been able to nail down. I actually solved it inadvertantly when refactoring our tanstack query hooks that are used across two different applications.

### What have I learned today?
I've learned how important testing is, to monitor regression. While doing a refactor yesterday had a few tests starting to fail that I was able to catch and fix before putting a pr up to my team.

## Journal
I will try to embrace the feeling of low journaling motivation. I think pushing through things just furthers desire to complete tasks, but if I follow the `Tiny Habits` concept just do the bare minimum to keep the habit up, and celebrate getting that done.
