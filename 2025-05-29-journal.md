description: I've done a lot of good work this week, but it has been bits and pieces not really a project like I had aimed to, but in the AI coding essentials, my next task is to make a personal project. So maybe I can still pull something out by end of day Friday.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Read class project brief, and make a plan.
2. Get on with it.
  - This isn't my normal way of doing things, I like to have an achievable or slightly stretchy goal for the time I have, but I think I'm going to go hard with a really light plan, and see what I can get done.

### What are my challenges today?
There's always challenges, but today I'm feeling confident and want to carry that confidence into my day I'm excited.
- A challenge will be to document what I am learning. When I'm focused I tend to strip away as much process as I can, but the process is important.

## End of Day
