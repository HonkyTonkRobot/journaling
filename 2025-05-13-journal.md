Author: Joel Anderson
description: I'm taking the AI coding course taught by JV one of the founders of Dev Academy. Interested to see what they think about using AI in coding, but mostly curious how I can use it to supercharge my learning and not, be a crutch.

## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
1. Get started on the course.
2. Get my post route setup for the CV-share app
3. Find another job to apply for

### What are my challenges today?
Getting it all done. I like to stack the cards against myself, so that I work quickly. I need to think about time boxing so I make sure I leave room for all of this, so here we go.

| Task | Time |
|--|--|
|Start course | 1hr |
| networking lunch | 1hr |
| post route | 3hr |
| job app | 2.5hr |

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I have, I got the course started, I completed my post route plus some refactoring, and I applied to another company that I have had my eye on.

### What have I learned today?
1. When debugging, make sure to restart your server :eyes:
2. gained better understanding of how to create a useState for a form object, making for nice refactored way to handle state on multiple inputs
3. practiced a post route front to back.
4. I learned how to make a pull request from a forked repo to the
upstream repo

## Journal
I forgot to add into my learnings the `new RegExp("pattern", "i")` for assigning a regular expression to a JS variable.
