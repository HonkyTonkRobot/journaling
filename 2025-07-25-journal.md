## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Goals today, finish off this bug hunting expedition. and Get back to RLS implementation, and code review.


### What are my challenges today?
I think today is a lighter work load day, and not following into the trap of taking it to easy. Obviously over doing it is not great for longevity, but not letting time slip away, because I still have a lot to do, but that mental feeling that it's lighter because of what I achieved throughout the week could come back to bite me.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
