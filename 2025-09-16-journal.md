## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To survive the day. I don't have a lot of energy so my goal is to achieve anything, and maybe to make it a short day.


### What are my challenges today?
I've been off work for two weeks, and finding getting back into it a bit difficult. My challenge is to not be too hard on myself, and to recognize what I achieve today, even if it's as good as most days.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I really don't want to be writing this journal but I like to think it's important to recognize when I am having bad days, or when things suck. This isn't supposed to be a greatest hits. It's supposed to be a journal. I don't know what's dragging me down, too much rest? and struggling to get back into the work flow? yesterday was fine. what's wrong today. I think getting up at 5am was one problem, but that happens sometimes.

I know tomorrow will be better, or the next day. All I know is my low points always bounce back, they occassionally take some time to get there.
