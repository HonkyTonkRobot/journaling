## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- Pick the 2 areas of focus for the next 90 days
- Knock out the next ticket up for the current project I'm on.


### What are my challenges today?
- coming into the day with a little bit of ambiguity of what that will be.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
1. success, I've chosen to focus on fitness and te reo Māori
2. Definitely did. knocked out 4 tickets today. It's been a very productive week compared to last week.

### What have I learned today?
I think today I really experience what trunk based git workflow can be like when done well. I just had a feature branch that I was working off, and everytime I complete a feature, and created a PR for just that part, describing the feature. It allowed me to have a sort of feature branch that was a larger topic but still be able to get small 3-5 commit merges integrated into main. I also, spent a lot of energy learning about creating a logger for console messages that is environment aware so I don't ship something to main with console messages needed for development.

## Journal
Really motivated this week, I've come out of my depression, and really firing on all cylinders. Had a few hard problems that I wasn't able to fully solve yesterday, but mostly was just crushing bugs all day long.

My 2 second improvements for the day is streamlining the journals more. Currently my journal naming convention is `<date>-journal.md` but the default entry into my journal is a journal, so why do I need to label it journal. I don't, and it makes it more tedious to type the new file name where is the date is pretty quick and gives me great practice hitting the number row of the keyboard. Additionally I've got filler content in my template title block that I always have to delete before updating so I am just going to remove that filler content.

I've been listening to _Marty Cagen's_ "Inspire". I think it's not really relevant to where I am on my entrepreneurly journey as I'm in a learning phase instead of a building business phase.
That being said it is a good book, and great to get solid insight to great product teams.

I see myself as a generalist, Product manager, designer, ~engineer~ Developer, the hole 3 legged stool so to speak. Not an expert in any but strong foundations in all 3, and I think with the advent of AI having this generalist skill set is going to server me well. The next business I start I see myself as a Product manager CEO type, that will find a strong Engineer CTO type. Even though I am learning to code I don't have that 10 years of experience like I do with business development and product design all be it in small business and industrial design.

### 90 day learning focus
- Te reo Māori
- fitness

I've really been enjoying learning vocabulary and a tiny amount of grammar while teaching/learning along side my kid, but I am reaching the point I'd really like some structured learning to start learning grammer, and bolster my vocabulary.

Fitness wise is going to be the real challenge, I find it hard to be disciplined when it comes to fitness, I used to be in shape, but that's because I was a competitive distance runner in high school running 100km a week, but now I definitely don't do that, and find the idea of getting back into shape impossibly hard. I've been thinking to do the P90x as a motivation and framework for keeping me focused, but I am unsure that I really want to do that. I like running maybe I'll do that, with some push-ups, sit ups, and pull ups. I need to get a pull up bar. who knows what the right choice is but what I know is I need accountability, but don't want to have to schedule with a frined to work out. Maybe I should put my daily workouts into my journal, not as a way to brag but as a way to share my progress on my learning to take care of myself goals. Eating well is a part of that, but I already eat pretty well besides my 10pm snack. so cut that out, and I am pretty good on that front, that's mostly thanks to having a healthy eating partner who has helped me convert my diet from $7 pizzas from domino's to ottolengi cooking.
