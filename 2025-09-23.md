## Journal
Really motivated this week, I've come out of my depression, and really firing on all cylinders. Had a few hard problems that I wasn't able to fully solve yesterday, but mostly was just crushing bugs all day long.

My 2 second improvements for the day is streamlining the journals more. Currently my journal naming convention is `<date>-journal.md` but the default entry into my journal is a journal, so why do I need to label it journal. I don't, and it makes it more tedious to type the new file name where is the date is pretty quick and gives me great practice hitting the number row of the keyboard. Additionally I've got filler content in my template title block that I always have to delete before updating so I am just going to remove that filler content.
