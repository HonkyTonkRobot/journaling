## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To power through the uncertainty. I've got some stuff to accomplish today, and it's going to be tough, so I will need to push myself, not too hard, but gotta use the grit I've got to get it done.


### What are my challenges today?
Not getting bogged down by constant context switching which I know today is going to be full of.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
Yea it was a solid day, successful navigated the context switching, and achieved quite a bit. :smiling:


### What have I learned today?
Oof, I can't really rememeber, I didn't get this done day of like normal and having trouble thinking of something I learned. I remember having something good to add too, but it slips the mind.:wq


## Journal
Today I have been working on a new complex feature that requires making a few new db tables and a join table to allow for a many-to-many relationship, and I spent a lot of time planning with claude code and one of the great learnings I've had from working with my team is before starting to plan is to ask your agent if they have any questions, it's amazing how the agents will be able to ask really useful questions to fill in the gaps in their context, it would be nice if they would just ask automagically but they are so eager to please that they don't. Today's refactor I answered 5 questions, then asked "any questions?" again, and it had 5 more. We did this about 5 times until I was confident in claudes understanding of what we were doing, and that a plan could be successful built correctly the first time. This leads to the next step making a phased plan which is great because you can read it and make sure the plan is on track with what you want it to do. I often save this to a file as I want to make sure to preserve the plan in case the context window changes or i have seperate chats ie computer dies or something like that. In this case the plan brought up 4 questions for me that I was able to ask before we started and get clarification and just allowed me to tighten up the plan.
