## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To power through the uncertainty. I've got some stuff to accomplish today, and it's going to be tough, so I will need to push myself, not too hard, but gotta use the grit I've got to get it done.


### What are my challenges today?
Not getting bogged down by constant context switching which I know today is going to be full of.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?
