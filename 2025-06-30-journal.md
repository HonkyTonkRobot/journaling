## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
- [x] To starting journaling again.
- [x] To have a retrospective on my last month of learning

### What are my challenges today?
I think finding that balance between learning and getting started on the next bit of work.

## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
I have absolutely reached my goals today! It felt really good to start consolidating my learnings over the last month.

### What have I learned today?
I focused most of my energy on Supabase, RLS, in Supabase server side cookies. Learning how the cookies need to be served differently, than with client side components in a Next.js application. Essentially with a server-side component it's sending the static content to the page and the http header is set, on the first chunk that get's rendered. So then when the next part get's rendered, it tries to update the header and fails, so in the supabase server side cookie handler, you allow it to fail gracefully, and then you manage cookie state within this component. Essentially this is what is validating auth, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to see who the logged in user was due to how the server side componnents work.  I'm still learning so my understanding is still a bit fuzzy, but I like to try and recall what I learned because It helps me understand what I retained and what I didn't.

## Journal
Yesterday was great, so I learned a bunch of things over the last month and was learning at the speed of light :lightning: So yesterday I started to consolidate that learning but, working for company that is really learning how to harness the power of AI as a productivity assistant, I decided to use what I have learned about using Tools like Claude Code to help me consolidate this learning. I wrote a prompt to feed into the Opus 4 model, with 11 different categories, from Supabase RLS to Next.js best practices, I then had it evaluate my code, and then teach me more about how I could improve what I had created, and generate quiz questions, and practice scenarios.  I've only worked through 1 of the topics, as they are about 2 hours of materials for each topic, but I can already see how it can not only be a tool for productivity, but also a tool for supercharging my learning. I've got an ambitious goal of being a Senior Engineer in 5 years, and I think this is going to be one of the tools that makes that possible, as long as I am disciplined in teaching myself.

Another interesting learning of the day, was learning what a singlton is. Basically ensures there is only ever one instance of an object or class.
