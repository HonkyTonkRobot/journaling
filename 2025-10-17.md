## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Keep punching out some tickets. Yesterday a few new ones were added to the GitHub project board, that are time senstive to some new users being onboarded, so going to shift focus to those tickets, which should be straight forward. Famous last words.


### What are my challenges today?
Just getting them done. It's friday after all and They are needed next week, so getting them done, and tested well enough to ship to production.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I've got a really exciting announcement. I'm going to be giving a talk to my peers at the Dev Grads Discord, which I believe is mostly Aotearoa New zealand dev grads. Pretty excited to share what my experience of being a newby in a new ai native world, and how I think it's affecting my journey.
