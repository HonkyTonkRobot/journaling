## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
To get this current ticket working. I've broken down the ticket into smaller more managable chunks and stripped all possible functionality back, as I want to make sure I get the core refactor done right. and have made this smaller enhancements a part of a continuation of the refactor.

### What are my challenges today?
I think my challenges today are dealing with adversity. I'm in an aggressive mood, and just want to brute force it, but I know being patient and moving a bit slower will actually be the things that make me succeed today, and that pushing to hard will just leave me feeling more frustrated. `Slow is fast, fast is slow.`


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
After reflecting on what I learned from this less than enjoyable experience, of having two days of work amount to nothing, is that I did learn something and that is to be more strategic about what you put into a refactor. I was trying to put all of the stuff I wanted the new feature to have, while doing a major refactor of the the db schema, and how the business logic/data layers interact with that schema.  This time (3rd try) I have stripped all extra functionality that is not the migration to this new schema. Even if the feature is enabled by the new schema, I am not implementing it. I am only implementing the refactor to the new schema. Once I have fully tested the app is fully functional with the new schema will I start to add the features that are enabled by this schema. I hope :pray: this is the right move, but I think it must be. I think I am learning to be more ruthless about what I consider an issue size.

### Let it all out
I normally am excited for the weekend because I have made great progress during the week and enjoy the downtime to refresh for another week. This week I feel like I keep falling on my face, and have not made the progress I needed to make.

It has been good learning, but also more painful than usual. I guess the story is that I tried one thing, and later after implementation realized it was flawed and over complicated, which meant a lot of the previously implemented features did not work well. This was because I was trying to add a new feature without refactoring the existing table schema. I thought if I kept it seperated that it would make things easier. Something I learned from the last project I worked on which turned out to be a great way of doing it. This time around though it just created a bunch of complex database calls that were either creating performance issues or just failing all together. So then I improved my plan but like some kind of moron, I tried to refactor from the broken one, and I got it working but man was it a mess. I should have just made a new branch off of main and continued. I have just started over again, and that is what I am doing this time around. I am fresh start, fresh branch off main, and this time I have made my plan even more rock solid so if I am here on monday feeling this journal with crying emoji's that will be because this plan didn't work out either.

I'm not ready for the weekend, because I want to get so much more done. I'll probably end up working over the weekend, not because I have to but because I want be able to enjoy the weekend until I solve this problem. Though at the same time I can feel myself getting more frustrated.
