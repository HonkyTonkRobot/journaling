## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Talk to the team, get up to speed on the changes, and pick up a ticket.


### What are my challenges today?
A bit unsure about where I need to focus, but to be expected when coming back from vacation. So, just stay aware of that and try and push through the uncertainty until I get back into the flow.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?
No, absolutely not. I think I am a bit worn out from trying to manage time with visiting family and work, and then working on the weekend on a project that needs coordination among many people. I got to a point where I had to stop due to blockers. Seemed unacceptable to burn the clock, especially when it was my own choice to work outside our normal hours due to personal conflicts. It's all good though it's a good learning lesson, and it will just mean I have a slightly longer week this week to cover those two hours I'd like to get paid for. I do love that I have a flexible job, and appreciative that I am fortunate enough to have a boss that trusts me to make these kinds of decisions, a big realization is sacrificing work or family commits is avoided when you have the trust and flexibility that my employer provides.


### What have I learned today?
I've learned that sometimes there are consequences to running a schedule that is not approximately in line with the rest of the team. I am still on track, but had to break up my flow, which has an effect on my productivity. Good learning, will help me think about how I make my work schedules going forward.

## Journal
I have noticed myself being grateful today, for family and work. I have a supportive family and I have a really wonderful job. I feel lucky to work with smart and kind people, and to have a boss that creates a wonderful working experience, which if anything just makes me want to do a great job for him.
