## Start of Day:

### What are my goals today?
Talk to the team, get up to speed on the changes, and pick up a ticket.


### What are my challenges today?
A bit unsure about where I need to focus, but to be expected when coming back from vacation. So, just stay aware of that and try and push through the uncertainty until I get back into the flow.


## End of Day

### Have I reached my goals today?


### What have I learned today?

## Journal
I have noticed myself being grateful today, for family and work. I have a supportive family and I have a really wonderful job. I feel lucky to work with smart and kind people, and to have a boss that creates a wonderful working experience, which if anything just makes me want to do a great job for him.
