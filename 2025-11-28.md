## Journal
I Love typing tests, for whatever reason I really enjoy typing which is funny because I am an average writer, so I guess that's why me default, is to take typing tests. I like [Monkey Type](https://monkeytype.com) And have started to plateu at 105 wpm (94% accuracy) [My Profile](https://monkeytype.com/profile/HonkyTonkRobot) And hitting a lot of 122 wpm with ~80% accuracy. So started looking at what the best typist do to get to 200-300 wpm :mind_blown: and discovered a technique called "alt-finger typing" This is very similar to "Touch Typing" the standard way to use a keyboard, every key has a default finger you use to hit the key. With alt-finger typing you switch fingers for different keys depending on the letters around that letter. The benefit is it reduces the number of back to back key presses with the same finger, meaning you can go much quicker. Boy it is hard to do. after years of touch typing and getting fairly proficient at it, it is hard. I can feel that I will be much faster once I get up to speed and have already found a few of them to be quite natural like U(middle finger) > N(point finger) instead of pointer finger for both. Right now I am achieving a measly 50 wpm 100% accuracy as I am focusing on accuracy instead of speed for the next two weeks before I try to go for speed. Having fun though.
